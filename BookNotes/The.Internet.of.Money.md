### Highlights

- I am a disruptarian. What that means is that every 30 or 40 years at least, things that have settled need to be disrupted. Because as they settle, power accumulates, they become centralized, and with centralized power, corruption happens. This isn’t a new concept. My ancestors—I come from Greece—figured out that corruption happens in systems of power, and absolute power produces absolute corruption. There is no more absolute power than the power over money.

- I’ve worked with a lot of bankers. They’re nice people. They try to feed their family, pay their mortgage, keep a steady job. Among them, there are a few sociopaths who inevitably rise to the highest positions of power because sociopathy is an advantage in hierarchical systems.

- Bitcoin is different because there are plenty of crooks in bitcoin — the network gets attacked all the time — but it doesn’t depend on access control to remain secure. It depends on a simple mathematical formula of incentives and rewards. ([Location 691](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01L9WM0H8&location=691))
- Which leads to the one inescapable conclusion about money: Money is a shared cultural hallucination. It’s a shared delusion. We walk around and associate with other people on the basis of germ-ridden pieces of cotton printed with green ink. ([Location 1314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01L9WM0H8&location=1314))
- Why is bitcoin money? Because other people think it’s money. You can write a dozen Ph.D. dissertations explaining exactly why bitcoin is not money . . . and I have lived on it for two years. Therefore, it doesn’t matter what your dissertation says. To me, it is money, because I have lived on it for two years. So have thousands of other people. Therefore, to me, it is very much real money. ([Location 1334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01L9WM0H8&location=1334))
- So, a “wallet” is not a wallet; it’s a keychain. That’s a terrible metaphor. You have expectations of what a wallet will do. It will contain things. These contents will be discrete and enumerated. None of that exists in bitcoin. ([Location 1356](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01L9WM0H8&location=1356))
- The essence of good design is picking the metaphor that informs expectations. ([Location 1375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01L9WM0H8&location=1375))
- There’s a certain concept called skeuomorphic design. The word skeuomorphic means “a shadow of its former self.” It’s form as a shadow. What it means is when you create elements in design that give you references or hints of some previous form. For example, a classic example, in the first iteration of iPads, the iOS software had a lot of skeuomorphic design. If you opened your contact database, it was bound in leather. ([Location 1379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01L9WM0H8&location=1379))
- It’s a really difficult task to design good metaphors for bitcoin because there is no parallel. We have never done this before. We fall into these traps of trying to extrapolate from our previous experience, and fall short. Disruptive technologies do this. In an incremental technology, if you take what you currently understand and then just use a milligram of vision and extend it just a tiny bit, you understand the new technology because it really is just a slight extension of the past. Bitcoin is a radical break from the past, so understanding the way traditional money works doesn’t help you understand bitcoin. ([Location 1396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01L9WM0H8&location=1396))
- Look back at Star Trek in the 1970s. What did they get right? They got tricorders. They got portable communicators. They got video telephony. They got all that was predictable with the technology of the 1970s. They couldn’t possibly get the internet. They couldn’t possibly understand the idea of networked information stores. They had fantastical computers that could talk to you, but they didn’t have access to any data. They couldn’t possibly predict things like social media. Most importantly, if you pay attention, you will notice something very strange. Star Trek doesn’t have any money at all. There is no money anywhere in the Star Trek universe. Why is that? Because their furthest vision of the possibility of society is a society without money, a society without a language for transmitting value, which is probably the most radical departure from reality. ([Location 1406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01L9WM0H8&location=1406))
- They couldn’t possibly predict the outcomes we saw on the internet, because most of the interesting things were not incremental improvements or extensions of the things before. They were radical departures from the past, because they created the conditions for things that were not possible before. ([Location 1426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01L9WM0H8&location=1426))
- The really interesting things in bitcoin happen in what I call “interstitial innovation”—the innovation in the gaps, the places where today’s systems cannot go. ([Location 1454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01L9WM0H8&location=1454))
- It changes what’s called the Coase coefficient, which is the overhead created by organization. If we want to do something as a team, two people can do more than what one person can do. Three people can achieve even more. But there’s a limit to that. Once you get too big, the communication overhead between participants in the group is greater than the marginal increase in efficiency. So, adding more people makes it worse, because the group is getting bigger too fast. ([Location 1478](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01L9WM0H8&location=1478))
- So, how do you appeal to a completely new demographic? Part of the trick is not trying to be a bank. Do not try to do anything related to traditional banking. All that does is pollute their mind. You want new users to have a brand new experience with bitcoin that is unlike any banking they will ever see. You don’t want it to look like a checking account. God forbid you use the word "checking.” Open any one of the exchanges right now—Circle, Coinbase. ([Location 1556](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01L9WM0H8&location=1556))
- It doesn’t have any of the good parts of a bank—like the ability to easily reverse transactions, to get a refund if you lose your private key. It doesn’t have any of those. It also doesn’t have any of the bad parts of banks, but we don’t pay attention to that. So, we’ve created expectations that are entirely misleading. ([Location 1583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01L9WM0H8&location=1583))
- There are really two types of companies out there: those that have failed to take the necessary action to secure the credit cards that you entrusted them with; and those that will soon fail to take the necessary security action to protect the credit cards you’ve entrusted them with. ([Location 1652](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01L9WM0H8&location=1652))
- Credit cards are broken by design because the token itself is the secret key. If you transmit that token, you expose your entire account to risk. ([Location 1656](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01L9WM0H8&location=1656))
- Bitcoin is fundamentally different. What I’m transmitting is not the key, but simply a signed message. It is an authorization. That authorization has two external references: (1) to where the money’s coming from by referencing an unspent output on the blockchain, and (2) a reference to where I want to send the money — by creating a new encumbrance, a new limitation on who can spend the money, usually a public key or bitcoin address. ([Location 1658](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01L9WM0H8&location=1658))
- Once you realize that money has become a content type, that transactions have been disconnected from the medium, some really important secondary characteristics emerge. You see, the medium is the message, as someone famous once said. The primary reason the medium is the message is because the medium constrains, transforms, and in many cases, distorts the message. ([Location 1719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01L9WM0H8&location=1719))
- When your medium is TV, your message is 18 minutes long, interrupted by advertising slots. That is your message; there is no other format you can fit there. So, you make a message that fits that medium. And you start assigning the value of your message based on the mistaken assumption that it is equivalent to the cost of production. ([Location 1722](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01L9WM0H8&location=1722))
- By separating the message from the medium, your perception of value shifts from the cost of production to the value it has to the consumer when they consume it. ([Location 1728](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01L9WM0H8&location=1728))
- Let me give you an even older example. When the cost of printing is astronomical and the means of printing are available only to a select few, the only thing you print is Gutenberg Bibles. The medium defines the range of expression of the message, and constrains it only to the most grandiose and important messages that society has. It limits the range of expression by imposing enormous costs of production. ([Location 1732](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01L9WM0H8&location=1732))
- When you make the mistaken assumption that if the cost of production is zero, and the message appears trivial on its face, then the entire combination of medium plus message must be worthless, must be trivial, must have no value — that’s a mistake that people have made at every turn in history. ([Location 1739](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01L9WM0H8&location=1739))
- When Twitter first came out, people assumed it would only be used for the trivial. And yet, a year ago I was watching CNN International covering the Egyptian revolution, and they were live-streaming tweets from Egyptian revolutionaries on the streets of Cairo, giving live reports about what is happening minute-by-minute. CNN anchors are doing nothing. They’re pointing at the screen and saying, "Look, we have another tweet. And here’s another tweet from someone we don’t know. Here’s another tweet." They’ve been reduced to the role of a TV show model saying, "And this wonderful refrigerator will be yours if you win the prize behind door number one.” I find it extremely gratifying to watch one of these talking heads, like Anderson Cooper, basically reduced to reading tweets off a screen. ([Location 1741](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01L9WM0H8&location=1741))
- I cannot send you 20 cents across the world, from one individual to another individual, because the medium constrains the message. The cost of production does not allow me to express that range of transactional expression. ([Location 1783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01L9WM0H8&location=1783))
- All of the very serious people will remain on the solid, quality payment networks of the past. Because if they can control and restrict the range of expression, they think that means it’s quality. It’s not. It’s just an inflated cost of production. It’s bare naked elitism at its worst. They cling to the medium and fail to see that now the message can be transported over any medium at zero cost, instantaneously. ([Location 1789](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01L9WM0H8&location=1789))
- Things get complicated because bitcoin isn’t what you think it is. It’s a platform. It’s not a payment network. It’s not a currency. It’s not a banking system. It’s a platform that guarantees certain trust functions. ([Location 1881](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01L9WM0H8&location=1881))
- What I loved about cooking is that it is the perfect combination of art and science. If you fundamentally understand how the ingredients work, how they behave, and how the chemistry changes when they’re combined or when you add a catalyst like salt or when you apply heat to them, then you can create. ([Location 1896](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01L9WM0H8&location=1896))
- Effectively, what the banks are saying to us is, "We focus tested this. What people want is the ability, instead of swiping their Visa card, to wave it over the reader, saving almost two seconds and reducing their effort by at least four calories. I mean, we could deal with the 4 billion people who have no access to banking or clean water. We could deal with the fact that our world is a fragmented mess, where the vast majority of humanity have no access to financial services. Or, we could reduce the shopper’s effort and make a swipe card into a float card. ([Location 1938](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01L9WM0H8&location=1938))
- This is how bitcoin is going to play out. This is not going to be solved; we will have the scaling discussion every year for decades into the future, hopefully. Every year, we will fail to scale for the next application and succeed to scale for the previous ones. As soon as we do better, people will invent new applications and we will fail to scale again. The internet: failing to scale gracefully for 25 years. Bitcoin: let’s keep failing to scale gracefully, and bitcoin is not yet dead.
