### Highlights

- The higher IQ people have, the better they are at pattern matching, and thus are quicker to fall for stereotypes.

- Confirmation Bias: Seeing what we expect to see, Desirability Bias: Seeing what we want to see.

- If Knowledge is power, knowing what we don't know is wisdom.

- When we lack the knowledge and skills to archive excellence, we sometimes lack the knowledge and skills to judge excellence.

- Arrogance is ignorance plus conviction.

- Have confidence in the ability to learn. We'll get this done, we just don't know how just yet.

- Feeling like an imposter can put us in Beginners Mindset, leading us to question assumptions that others have taken for granted.

- Uncertainty primes us to ask questions and absorb new ideas.

- Ideas survive not because they are true, but because they are interesting.

- Being Wrong is the only way I feel sure I've learned something - Danny Kahneman

- Who you are should be a question about what you value, not what you believe.

- When we define ourselves by values rather than opinions, we buy ourselves the flexibility to update our practice in light of new evidence.

- It's a sign of wisdom to avoid believing every thought that enters your mind.

- It's a sign of emotional intelligence to avoid internalizing every feeling that enters your heart.

- There is no benefit to me for being wrong for longer. It's much better if I change my beliefs sooner, and it's a good feeling to have that sense of a discovery, that suprise, I would think people enjoy that. - Kjirste Morell

- If we're insecure, we make fun of others. If we're comfortable being wrong, we're not afraid of poking fun at ourselves.

- Taking Responsibility is taking the power back.

- The absence of conflict is not harmony, it's apathy.

- We learn more from people who challenge our thought process than those who affirm our conclusions.

- Exhausting someone in argument is not the same as convincing them - Tim Kreider

- A logic bully, [...] you just overwhelm me with rational arguments, and I don't agree with them, but I can't fight back.

- The more forceful the logical attack, the more the other person digs down their heels.

- A debate is a kind of negotiation, where you're trying to reach an agreement about the truth.

- In a negotiation, agreeing with someone else's argument is disarming. Try to find common ground.

- A weak argument generally dilutes a strong one.

- A good debate is not a war. If it's not even a tug-of-war, where you can drag your opponent to your side if you pull hard enough on the rope. It's more like a dance that hasn't been choreographed, negotiated with a partner who has a different set of steps in mind. If you try too hard to lead, your partner will resist. If you can adopt your moves to hers, and get her to do the same, you're more likely to end up in rhythms.

- You should be willing to listen to what someone else is saying and give them a lot of credit for it. It makes you sound like a reasonable person who is taking everything into account.

- People tend to see quantity as a sign of quality. The more the topic matters to them, the more the quality of the reason matters. It's when people are skeptical of our view, have a stake in the issue, and tend  to be stubborn that piling on justification is most likely to backfire.

- A single line of argument feels like a conversation; multiple lines of arguments can become an onslaught. The audience tuned out the preacher and summoned their best prosecutor.

- As important as quantity and quality of reason might be, source matters, too. And the most convincing source is often the one closest to our audience.

- Psychologist have long found out that the person most likely to persuade you to change your mind is you. You get to pick the reason you find most compelling, and you come away with a real sense of ownership over them.

- When we point out that there are areas where we agree and acknowledge that they have some valid points, we model confident humility and encourage them to follow suit.

- We don't have to convince them that we are right, we just need to open their mind to the possibility that they might be wrong. Their natural curiosity might to the rest.

- Many studies across a range of industries have shown that once people are earning enough to meet their basic needs, paying them more does not stop them from leaving bad jobs or bosses.

- When someone becomes hostile, if you respond by viewing the arguments as a war, you can either attack or retreat. If instead you threat it as a dance, you have another option - to sidestep.

- The more anger and hostility the other person express, the more curiosity and interest you show. When someone is loosing control, your tranquility is a sign of strength. It takes the wind out of their emotional sail.

- In a heated argument, you could always stop and ask: "What evidence would change your mind?" If the answer is "nothing", there is no point in continuing the debate. You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it think.

- There's evidence that people are more interested in hiring candidates who acknowledge legitimate weakness as opposed to bragging or humblebragging.

- A rivalry exists whenever we reserve special animosity for a group we see competing with us for resources or threatening our identities.

- As stereotypes stick and prejudice deepens, we don't just identify with our own group; we disidentify with our adversaries, coming to define who we are by what we're not.

- In every human society, people are motivated to seek belonging and status. Identifying with a group checks both boxes at the same time: We become part of a tribe, and we take pride when our tribe wins.

- Psychologist George Kelly observed that our beliefs are like pairs of reality googles. We use them to make sense of the world and navigate our surrounding. A threat to our opinions cracks our goggles, leaving our vision blurred. It's only natural to put up our guard in response - and Kelly notices that we become especially hostile when trying to defend opinions that we know, deep down, are false.

- Socially, there's another reason stereotypes are sticky. We tend to interact with people who share them, which makes them even more extreme. This phenomenon is called group polarization, and it's been demonstrated in hundreds of experiments.

- Polarization is reinforced by conformity: peripheral members fit in and gain status by following the lead of the most prototypical members of the group, who often holds the most intense views.

- The overview effect is a cognitive change of consciousness, reported by some astronauts and cosmonauts during spaceflight. After observing our planet from the universe, they feel an obligation and responsibility to take care of that fragile blue dot forever. When you get to see an overview of the Earth from outer space, you realize you share a common identity with all human beings. Term coined by Frank White.

- When we meet group members who defy a stereotype, our first instincts isn't to see them as examples and rethink the stereotype. It's to see them as exceptions and cling to our existing beliefs. 

- If you reflect on it, though, hating an opposing team is an accident of birth. If you had been born in New York instead of Boston, would you really hate the Yankees?

- In psychology, counterfactual thinking involves imagining how the circumstances of our lives could have unfolded differently. When we realize how easily we could have held different stereotypes, we might be more willing to update our views.

- People gain humility when they reflect on how different circumstances could have led them to different beliefs.

- Psychologist find that many of our beliefs are cultural truism: widely shared, bur rarely questioned.

- As a general rule, it's those with greater power who need to do more of the rethinking, both because they're more likely to privilege their own perspectives and because their perspectives are more likely to go unquestioned.

- When we choose not to engage with people because of their stereotypes or prejudice, we give up on opening their minds.

- It' a rare person who wants to hear what he doesn't want to hear - Attributed to Dick Cavett.

- This is a common problem in persuasion: what doesn't sway us can make our beliefs stronger. Much like like a vaccine inoculates our physical immune system against a virus, the act of resistance fortifies our psychological immune system.

- Motivational interviewing, the central premise is that we can rarely motivate someone else to change. We're better off helping them find their own motivation to change. The process of motivational interviewing involves three key techniques: Asking open-ended questions, engaging in reflective listening, affirming the person's desire and ability to change.

- The goal isn't to tell people what to do; it's to help them break out of overconfidence cycles and see new possibilities.

- When people ignore advice, it isn't always because they disagree with it. Sometimes they're resisting the sense of pressure and the feeling that someone else is controlling their decisions.

- Listening well is more than a matter of talking less. It's a set of skills in asking and responding. It starts with showing more interest in other people's interests rather than trying to judge their status or prove our own.

- Although people want a doctor to fix their broken bones, when it comes to the prolems in their heads, they often want sympathy rather than solutions.

- Even the devil appreciates being listened to. - Betty Bigombe

- In a series of experiments, interacting with an empathetic, nonjudgmental, attentive listener made people less anxious and defensive.

- Many communicators try to make themselves look smart. Great listeners are more interested in making their audiences feel smart.

- The power of listening doesn't lie just in giving people the space to reflect on their views. It's a display of respect and an expression of care.

- Listening is a way of offering others our scarcest, most precious gift: our attention.

- Binary bias: It's a basic human tendency to seek clarity and closure by simplifying a complex continuum in two categories.

- Skepticism is foundational to the scientific method, whereas denial is the a priori rejection of ideas without objective consideration.

- When we're reading listening, or watching, we can learn to recognize complexity as a signal of credibility. We can favor content and sources that present many sides of an issue rather than just one or two.

- Experiments have shown that when experts express doubt, they become more persuasive.

- Psychologists find that people will ignore or even deny the existence of of a problem if they're not fond of the solution.

- Acknowledging complexity doesn't make speakers and writers less convincing; it makes them more credible. It doesn't lose viewers and readers; it maintains their engagement while stoking their curiosity.

- If you find yourself saying XXXX is always good or XXXX is never bad, you may be a member of an idea cult. Appreciating complexity reminds us that no behavior is always effective and that all cures have unintended consequences.

- Perspective-taking consistently fails because we're terrible mind readers. We're just guessing. If we can't understand someone, we can't have a eureka moment by imagining his perspective. What works is not perspective-taking but perspective-seeking: actually talking to people to gain insight into the nuances of their views.

- It turns out that even if we disagree strongly with someone on a social issue, when we discover that she cares deeply about the issue, we trust her more. We might still dislike her, but we see her passion for a principle as a sign of integrity. We reject the beliefs but grow to respect the person behind it.

- It turns out that although perfectionists are more likely than their peers to ace school, they don't perform any better than their colleagues at work. This tracks with evidence that, across a wide range of industries, grades are not a strong predictor of job performance.

- Psychologists find that one of the hallmarks of an open mind is responding to confusion with curiosity and interest.

- Confusion can be a cue that there's new territory to be explored or a fresh puzzle to be solved.

- Quality means rethinking, reworking, and polishing - Ron Berger

- Good teachers introduce new thought, but great teachers introduce new ways of thinking.

- If it weren't for the people... earth would be an engineer's paradise. - Kurt Vonnegut

- Although NASA accomplished extraordinary things, they soon become victims of overconfidence cycles. As people took pride in their standard operating procedures, gaining conviction in their routines, and saw their decisions validated through their results, the missed opportunities for rethinking.

- Rethinking is more likely to happen in a learning culture, where growth is the core value and rethinking cycles are routine. In learning cultures, the norm is for people to know what they don't know, doubt their existing practices, and stay curious about new routines to try out. Evidence shows that in learning cultures, organizations innovate more and make fewer mistakes.

- Psychologically safe teams reported more errors, but the actually made fewer errors. By freely admitting their mistakes, they were then able to learn what had caused them and eliminate them moving forward. In psychological unsafe teams, people hid their mishaps to avoid penalties, which made it difficult for anyone to diagnose the root causes and prevent future problems. They kept repairing the same problems.

- The most important factor in teams isn't who is on them or how meaningful they find the work: it is how psychologically safe they felt.

- In performance cultures, we also censor ourselves in the presence of experts who seem to know all the answers - especially if we lack confidence in our own expertise.

- 'How do you know?' It's a question we need to ask more often, both of ourselves and others. The power lies in its frankness. It's nonjudgmental - a straightforward expression of doubt and curiosity that doesn't put people on the defensive.

- By admitting some of their imperfections out loud, managers demonstrated that they could take it - and make a public commitment to remain open to feedback. They normalized vulnerability, making their teams more comfortable opening up about their own struggles.

- It takes confident humility to admit that we're a work in progress. It shows that we care more about improving ourselves than proving ourselves.

- In performance cultures, people often become attached to best practices. The risk is that once we've declared a routine the best, it becomes frozen in time. We preach about its virtues and stop questioning its vices, no longer curious about where it's imperfect and where it could improve.

- Focusing on results might be good for short-term performance, but it can be an obstacle to long term learning.

- Exclusively praising and rewarding results is dangerous because it breeds overconfidence in poor strategies, incentivizing people to keep doing things the way they've always done them.

- Research shows that when we have to explain the procedures behind our decisions in real time, we think more critically and process the possibilities more thoroughly.

- When psychological safety exists without accountability, people tend to stay within their comfort zone, and when there's accountability but no safety, people tend to stay silent in an anxiety zone. When we combine the two, we create a learning zone.

- Rethinking is more likely when we separate the initial decision makers from the later decision evaluators.

- Escalation of commitment: When we dedicate ourselves to a plan and it isn't going as we hoped, our first instinct isn't usually to rethink it. Instead, we tend to double down and sink more resources in the plan. This pattern is called escalation of commitment.

- Escalation of commitment happens because we're rationalizing creatures, constantly searching for self-justification for our prior beliefs as a way to soothe our egos, shield our images, and validate our past decisions.

- Tell the kids the truth... You can be anything yo're good at... as long as they're hiring. - Chris Rock

- We might be better off learning about careers as actions to take rather than as identities to claim.

- When we pursue happiness, we often start by changing our surroundings. We expect to find bliss in a warmer climate or a friendlier dorm, but any joy that those choices bring about is typically temporary.

- You can't get away from yourself by moving from one place to another. - Ernest Hemingway

- Our happiness often depends more on what we do than where we are. It's our actions - not our surroundings - that bring us meaning and belonging.

- Passions are often developed, not discovered. Passion grows as we we gain momentum and mastery.

- Careers, relationships, and communities are examples of what scientists call open systems - they're constantly in flux because they're not closed off from the environments around them.

- Writing out a plan for your life is like driving at night in the fog. You can only see as far as your headlights, but you can make the whole trip that way. - E.L Doctorow
