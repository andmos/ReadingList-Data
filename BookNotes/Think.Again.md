### Highlights

- The higher IQ people have, the better they are at pattern matching, and thus are quicker to fall for stereotypes.

- Confirmation Bias: Seeing what we expect to see, Desirability Bias: Seeing what we want to see.

- If Knowledge is power, knowing what we don't know is wisdom.

- When we lack the knowledge and skills to archive excellence, we sometimes lack the knowledge and skills to judge excellence.

- Arrogance is ignorance plus conviction.

- Have confidence in the ability to learn. We'll get this done, we just don't know how just yet.

- Feeling like an imposter can put us in Beginners Mindset, leading us to question assumptions that others have taken for granted.

- Uncertainty primes us to ask questions and absorb new ideas.

- Ideas survive not because they are true, but because they are interesting.

- Being Wrong is the only way I feel sure I've learned something - Danny Kahneman

- Who you are should be a question about what you value, not what you believe.

- When we define ourselves by values rather than opinions, we buy ourselves the flexibility to update our practice in light of new evidence.

- It's a sign of wisdom to avoid believing every thought that enters your mind.

- It's a sign of emotional intelligence to avoid internalizing every feeling that enters your heart.

- There is no benefit to me for being wrong for longer. It's much better if I change my beliefs sooner, and it's a good feeling to have that sense of a discovery, that suprise, I would think people enjoy that. - Kjirste Morell

- If we're insecure, we make fun of others. If we're comfortable being wrong, we're not afraid of poking fun at ourselves.

- Taking Responsibility is taking the power back.

- The absence of conflict is not harmony, it's apathy.

- We learn more from people who challenge our thought process than those who affirm our conclusions.

- Exhausting someone in argument is not the same as convincing them - Tim Kreider

- A logic bully, [...] you just overwhelm me with rational arguments, and I don't agree with them, but I can't fight back.

- The more forceful the logical attack, the more the other person digs down their heels.

- A debate is a kind of negotiation, where you're trying to reach an agreement about the truth.

- In a negotiation, agreeing with someone else's argument is disarming. Try to find common ground.

- A weak argument generally dilutes a strong one.

- A good debate is not a war. If it's not even a tug-of-war, where you can drag your opponent to your side if you pull hard enough on the rope. It's more like a dance that hasn't been choreographed, negotiated with a partner who has a different set of steps in mind. If you try too hard to lead, your partner will resist. If you can adopt your moves to hers, and get her to do the same, you're more likely to end up in rhythms.

- You should be willing to listen to what someone else is saying and give them a lot of credit for it. It makes you sound like a reasonable person who is taking everything into account.

- People tend to see quantity as a sign of quality. The more the topic matters to them, the more the quality of the reason matters. It's when people are skeptical of our view, have a stake in the issue, and tend  to be stubborn that piling on justification is most likely to backfire.

- A single line of argument feels like a conversation; multiple lines of arguments can become an onslaught. The audience tuned out the preacher and summoned their best prosecutor.

- As important as quantity and quality of reason might be, source matters, too. And the most convincing source is often the one closest to our audience.

- Psychologist have long found out that the person most likely to persuade you to change your mind is you. You get to pick the reason you find most compelling, and you come away with a real sense of ownership over them.

- When we point out that there are areas where we agree and acknowledge that they have some valid points, we model confident humility and encourage them to follow suit.

- We don't have to convince them that we are right, we just need to open their mind to the possibility that they might be wrong. Their natural curiosity might to the rest.

- Many studies across a range of industries have shown that once people are earning enough to meet their basic needs, paying them more does not stop them from leaving bad jobs or bosses.

- When someone becomes hostile, if you respond by viewing the arguments as a war, you can either attack or retreat. If instead you threat it as a dance, you have another option - to sidestep.

- The more anger and hostility the other person express, the more curiosity and interest you show. When someone is loosing control, your tranquility is a sign of strength. It takes the wind out of their emotional sail.

- In a heated argument, you could always stop and ask: "What evidence would change your mind?" If the answer is "nothing", there is no point in continuing the debate. You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it think.

- There's evidence that people are more interested in hiring candidates who acknowledge legitimate weakness as opposed to bragging or humblebragging.

- A rivalry exists whenever we reserve special animosity for a group we see competing with us for resources or threatening our identities.

- As stereotypes stick and prejudice deepens, we don't just identify with our own group; we disidentify with our adversaries, coming to define who we are by what we're not.

- In every human society, people are motivated to seek belonging and status. Identifying with a group checks both boxes at the same time: We become part of a tribe, and we take pride when our tribe wins.
