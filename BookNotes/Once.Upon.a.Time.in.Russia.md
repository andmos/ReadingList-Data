### Highlights

- In truth, the Lada had become the first symbol of the new, free Russia. Owning a Lada was everything, and to get one a person needed more than money. You also needed knowledge of the right person to bribe. Berezovsky hadn’t set his sights on owning a Lada; he’d set his sights on the company that made them. Initially, he’d worked with the skill set he’d acquired in his academic life; he’d founded LogoVAZ as a computer software company aimed at solving numerical payment issues for the newly accountable auto conglomerate. Working his way deeper into the sprawling corporate behemoth, he’d quickly realized that the men who’d been placed in charge of AvtoVAZ were functionaries of the old world: dinosaurs who didn’t understand the economic changes exploding around them. These Red Directors, as the history books would eventually label them, had been handed the reins of major companies across every industry by a government that itself hardly understood the capitalist world that perestroika had unleashed.

- Bulletproof limousines, high-priced bodyguards, paid mercenaries: business as usual under perestroika. ([Location 210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=210))

- Litvinenko felt as lost as the youngest of his underlings. In his opinion, the FSB was a shadow of its precursor. Certainly, if his dwindling paycheck was any indication, the “revival of the economy” was going a lot better for the “civilized businessmen” blowing each other up in Mercedes limousines than for the men charged with keeping tabs on the mayhem. ([Location 269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=269))

- Krysha—literally, roof—was a uniquely Russian concept. Originally, the term had its roots in the world of organized crime; gangsters were only as powerful as their “roof”—the person or organization that protected them in case things went awry. The form of protection a “roof” might offer could be physical, economic, political, or even personal; although the concept was often loaded with the threat of real violence, the most effective forms of krysha never had to resort to guns and bombs. An implication of threat was often far more chilling than when pressure was applied. In the realm of business, the concept of krysha—a protective roof—was no different, but without the essential criminal link. The Red Directors who had at first inherited the newly privatized companies of the ex-Soviet regime had, some might argue, the ultimate roof—a government that would protect them as long as they stayed in favor. Private businessmen—men like Berezovsky—needed a different sort of roof to protect them as they chased their ambitions. Increasingly, these businessmen were turning to the very organizations that had coined the term, with varying results. ([Location 291](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=291))

- By the end of his stay, he had come to an important decision: simply being a businessman in modern Russia was no longer enough. In Russia, the walls didn’t hold up the roof; the roof kept the walls from falling in. Without a strong roof, no matter how lavish your house, it would eventually come down. ([Location 332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=332))

- Which was why, now, almost six months later, he had been spending nearly every day at the Presidential Club. The sprawling complex—Boris Yeltsin’s pride and joy, which he had modeled after a sporting resort he had once visited in the Urals—was much more than an adult playground. From the steam rooms to the indoor tennis courts, these were the true halls of power in the Yeltsin administration. You wanted to get something done, you didn’t go to the Kremlin—you grabbed a tennis racket and booked a court. ([Location 334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=334))

- The truth was, Berezovsky had not invented the concept of privatization. The planned economy had vanished—and something needed to take its place. Privatization, the idea of taking companies away from the state and essentially handing them to financiers and businessmen, was technically the brainchild of an economist named Anatoly Chubais, a brilliant young deputy in the Yeltsin government. It had begun as a noble idea—a way to offer the nation’s resources directly to the people, in the form of vouchers that acted as stock certificates. But the voucher program had failed almost immediately, a victim of the massive inflation that had helped make Berezovsky so wealthy. This had led to a shift, from a voucher program aimed at the common man to options sold to the only people who had enough money left to purchase them—the small group of businessmen who had taken an early advantage in the new economy. ([Location 402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=402))

- When one of the largest oil companies in the nation went into a privatization auction, a company valued at many billions of dollars ended up selling for close to two hundred fifty million. Timber, copper, automobiles, textiles—one after another, Russia’s major industries ended up in the hands of a small group of like-minded businessmen. ([Location 409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=409))

- Abramovich had started nowhere—truly, nowhere—orphaned by the age of four, his mother a victim of a blood disorder, his father killed in an accident at a construction site. He’d been shipped off to the Komi Republic to live with relatives—one of the harshest environments on the planet, a frozen tundra at the edge of the Arctic Circle where it was dark for more than three months out of the year. He’d studied engineering but had never graduated; after a stint in the army, he’d become a mechanic—but even at an early age, he’d seen himself as an entrepreneur. ([Location 549](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=549))

- “There’s a difference between businessmen and gangsters.” “Yes,” Berezovsky said. “Usually it’s the size of their wallet.” ([Location 646](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=646))

- They say that in business everything is timing, and in this case, the timing could not have been more perfect; Abramovich, with his idea of combining the two state-owned businesses—the oil refinery in Omsk and the production company in Noyabrsk—had caught Berezovsky at exactly the right moment; falling directly in the midst of his privatization of ORT, in an effort to advance the candidacy of Yeltsin in the upcoming election. ([Location 841](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=841))

- The privatization system had been honed through practice in the short time since Berezovsky had fought his way to a stake in ORT, beginning in late fall of 1994. Since then, through 1995 and into 1996, the Russian government, desperate for funds to shore up its abysmal financial situation, had embarked on what was commonly known as a “loans for shares” program. Simply put, shares of state owned conglomerates were offered as collateral for “loans” that were in turn auctioned off for cash, usually to privately held banks. When the state defaulted on these loans—which, from the very beginning, it fully intended to do—the bank either became the owner of the shares, or sold them in a prearranged transaction to a new private owner. These “loans for shares” auctions had already transferred some of the country’s largest companies into the hands of a few lucky souls. The largest nickel manufacturer in Russia had been traded for 170 million dollars—and was now a private company that would soon be worth more than one billion dollars. ([Location 865](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=865))

- Mikhael Khodorkovsky, a brilliant young physicist who had gone into banking, among other things, had achieved a nearly eighty percent controlling stake in Yukos, one of the country’s largest oil companies, for around 350 million dollars—a deal that would soon make him the richest man in Russia and, indeed, one of the richest men in the world. ([Location 873](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=873))

- The most profitable and important business, he had told anyone who would listen, was politics. ([Location 997](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=997))

- Between them, they already accounted for almost fifty percent of the nation’s GDP. Seven men, with the wealth of half a country in their hands—and they were in the process of buying not just an election but a government. ([Location 1016](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=1016))

- It would be enormously painful for the president, but it would send a clear pro-democracy message. Yeltsin wasn’t going to take the election by force; he was going to take it by vote. The loss of Korzhakov would hurt Yeltsin deeply, but it might very well ensure his victory. ([Location 1072](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=1072))

- Of course, Litvinenko knew better than anyone that Berezovsky was his own best propagandist. The stories he told in their evening sessions grew more extravagant the more the vodka flowed—or the more ears were turned in the Oligarch’s direction. These stories ranged from the merely humorous to the fabulously extreme—from tales of Berezovsky single-handedly saving Yeltsin, democracy, and capitalism, to stories about his rapidly growing portfolio of businesses—Sibneft, ORT, and now Aeroflot, the national airline—to narratives that seemed so insane it was impossible to know if they could be true—such as the story of Berezovsky rescuing, again single-handedly, a group of hostages held by Chechen rebels by showing up in person on his private jet, and trading the poor civilians’ safety for a hundred-thousand-dollar Patek Philippe watch. ([Location 1096](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=1096))

- Berezovsky had never been richer; his wealth had been estimated to be close to three billion dollars, though nobody knew for certain. Directly after the elections, Abramovich’s oil company had sprung up in value by, some said, more than a factor of twenty. Berezovsky, in turn, was receiving payments on an almost weekly basis. It seemed that all he needed to do was pick up the phone and dial, and a suitcase would arrive filled with US dollars. ([Location 1105](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=1105))

- Litvinenko had begun to believe that the only thing bigger than Boris Berezovsky’s delusions of grandeur was Boris Berezovsky’s actual life. ([Location 1113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=1113))

- Litvinenko was acting as if he were on his way to the gallows, when in fact he was really on his way into history. He’d blown the loudest whistle in agency history, and Berezovsky was proud of his employee and friend. ([Location 1191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=1191))

- When Berezovsky had met this man years earlier, he was little more than an assistant. At the time, Berezovsky had needed aid in setting up a car dealership in St. Petersburg, and the mayor of the city had handed him off to his deputy—a former long-term KGB officer by the name of Vladimir Putin. Berezovsky had been impressed immediately by the young man’s efficiency, and at a dinner party, he had learned a bit more about the man’s background. A child of poverty, like so many in Russia, Putin had grown up for a time in a communal apartment. He hadn’t been a wonderful student, but he was an impressive athlete who had gone on to become a judo champion. After stints studying law and language, he had matriculated right into the KGB, and had then put in more than sixteen years as a dutiful agent. His main job had apparently been analyzing foreign agents and trying to turn them. He had been stationed in Germany, where he’d married, had a couple of daughters, and then come back home to work at the University of St. Petersburg for a former teacher—who, in turn, was elected mayor of the city. And even though Putin had spent so much time in the security agency, he had democratic leanings; in 1991, when Yeltsin took power and communism fell, he left the KGB. ([Location 1209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=1209))

- the most important characteristics Yeltsin had been looking for in appointments had been loyalty, efficiency, and strength—and these were things that defined the former KGB man. When Putin’s boss, the mayor, had lost his own election in 1996, Putin had the opportunity to work for the winning party. Instead, he resigned, remaining loyal to his mentor. ([Location 1219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=1219))

- When you were placing a man in a position of power, you wanted someone who was loyal in the best meaning of the word—you wanted a perfect cog. ([Location 1221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=1221))

- But Berezovsky could also see, in the way Putin avoided looking at the young agent, from the way he skimmed through the evidence without any sense of shock or disgust about what he was seeing, that his years with the KGB had made him inherently suspicious of a man who had turned on the security agency. ([Location 1230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=1230))

- Concealing himself in a corner of the Interfax conference room, obscured by the shadows cast by the drawn shades of the long hall filled with row after row of journalists, Berezovsky listened as Litvinenko kicked off the conference—speaking carefully into the microphones, telling much the same story he had told in the private videotaping session, for the secret tape that Berezovsky still had in his possession. Detailing the orders to assassinate Berezovsky and a number of other wealthy businessmen, detailing kidnapping plots and any number of corrupt decrees from their superiors at the FSB. In the end, asking, begging Mr. Putin to clean up the agency. ([Location 1254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=1254))

- Abramovich was no stranger to this frozen corner of Russia. He had grown up a long stone’s throw from this section of Siberia, and he had built his trading business in the oil fields and refineries just a few stops down along the trans-Siberian railroad. ([Location 1272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=1272))

- In the beginning, it was payments to keep ORT afloat; but since the election in 1996, the focus seemed to shift to keeping Berezovsky’s lifestyle intact. The money had gone to purchase rare works of art for the Oligarch’s homes and offices; to settle girlfriends’ credit card bills; to help pay for at least one yacht, a private airplane, and even three French châteaus in the Antibes. All of it under the table, without any papers being filled out or contracts being signed. Just a phone call or a visit from Badri, followed by a suitcase full of money. There was no real paper trail, but if Abramovich had to calculate it, he believed that, in 1996 alone, he had paid at least thirty million to his krysha. In 1997, it had to be closer to fifty million. In 1998, maybe seventy or eighty million more. So much money, in such a crazy fashion: at Sibneft, they had simply begun to refer to the payments as Project Boris, which everyone accepted, if reluctantly, as the price of doing business. ([Location 1309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=1309))

- Without the Oligarch’s continued connections to the Kremlin and to the Family, Sibneft would not have existed—and there was always the chance that, without Berezovsky, the company would suddenly find itself out of the good graces of the Yeltsin government. The higher Berezovsky rose, the greater his political status and, the thinking went, the better it was for Sibneft. ([Location 1318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=1318))

- Abramovich simply had to accept that, often, he was writing checks that had more to do with inflating the entity known as Boris Berezovsky more than any particular business concern. ([Location 1321](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=1321))

- Berezovsky knew how to work the Kremlin, knew how to leverage friendships and political power to make things happen—and he knew how to use a telephone to ask for money. His only other truly impressive skill was that he knew, better than most, how to spot and take advantage of opportunities. ([Location 1336](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=1336))

- The new head of the FSB, Putin, had deemed Litvinenko a betrayer and traitor for turning on his agency. To Putin, the corruption that Litvinenko had revealed was less important than the disloyalty he had exhibited. ([Location 1417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=1417))

- Berezovsky had told him on one of his visits to Lefortovo that they should have foreseen the young FSB director’s opinion on the matter; the reason Putin had been brought to Moscow from St. Petersburg in the first place was his steadfast belief in loyalty. ([Location 1419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=1419))

- In 1996, Berezovsky had been able to call together the Oligarchs, who were able to work together to essentially buy themselves a government. ([Location 1464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=1464))

- Putin obviously saw Litvinenko as a traitor to the agency, his actions a betrayal to their code. Even so, firing the whistle-blower should have been enough. Having him arrested, sent to prison, and then rearrested after he served eight months, much of it in solitary confinement, seemed extreme. The dramatic scene—men in masks with submachine guns dragging him right out of the courtroom—was something directly out of the old KGB playbook. ([Location 1473](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=1473))

- Berezovsky found Putin surprisingly bright, even though he said little. He was conservative, to a fault, and held some level of fascination and nostalgia for the strong institutions of the old world—but he was also a true believer in the current democratic state, and the capitalistic forces that had opened up Russia since Yeltsin had taken power. Berezovsky found himself quite entranced by Putin, as he had become with Roman Abramovich, and had genuinely begun to consider him a friend. Even so, in political terms, he would most likely have still described the man as a useful cog, someone who could be trusted to behave loyally and without guile. ([Location 1486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=1486))

- As forward-thinking as Yeltsin’s government had been—liberating the economy from the state through privatization and building a democracy—the one thing they had not constructed was an official party. ([Location 1515](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=1515))

- But, even as Putin’s popularity rose, he had been reluctant when faced with the idea of actually running for president; Berezovsky himself had spent time trying to convince the ex-KGB agent that he was needed, to save what they had built. Even so, it wasn’t until Yeltsin himself pleaded with him, explaining that he was their best hope, that he finally acquiesced. Yeltsin understood that Putin had shown himself to be exactly the sort of strong-willed man of the people who the Russian populace loved. ([Location 1531](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=1531))

- Putin’s jump in the popularity polls after his decisive handling of the Chechen situation was proof. Not diplomacy, not words, but precise, definite action—that’s what the Russian people wanted. ([Location 1541](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=1541))

- Not only was this event unexpected—it was entirely unheard of: a seated president, one who had held on to power through every means possible, resigning on New Year’s Eve, six months before the presidential election. Handing over the presidency to his prime minister—Vladimir Putin, a man who had really seemed to come from nowhere, a former KGB officer and recent head of the FSB, a prime minister who had thrilled the country by his use of force in Chechnya, but who otherwise had a fairly blank résumé, a shadow for a history. ([Location 1612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=1612))

- Yeltsin’s exit had come without warning. As he had said in his own resignation speech, the expectations had been for him to try to hold onto power no matter what the cost—eventually, the assumption was, he’d have to be dragged out of office by his hands and feet. After all, this was a man who had survived multiple coup attempts, multiple heart attacks, the fall of an economy, and two wars in Chechnya. And yet he had just handed the presidency over without a single shot fired. ([Location 1616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=1616))

- “Those who combine power and capital—in the future, these Oligarchs will cease to exist as a class.” Berezovsky had been shocked by the sweep and ferocity of the statement. As different news programs analyzed the conference, the consensus was that Putin was calling for the elimination of Berezovsky and his colleagues as a power bloc. These were frightening words—and to Berezovsky, who had been funding Putin’s rise in the polls, they’d come out of nowhere. ([Location 1649](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=1649))

- Words were words. Berezovsky was a master of words, and he knew they were only as strong as the intent of the men who spoke them. ([Location 1665](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=1665))

- There was nothing a man like Putin hated more than the feeling of impotence. ([Location 1806](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=1806))

- An architectural wonder, the tower—essentially a radio tower that also housed a restaurant and an observation deck—had been built in the late sixties, but was under constant reconstruction and repair—perhaps making it an even more apt emblem of the Russian state. ([Location 1895](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=1895))

- Putin squeezed the Georgian’s shoulder as he led him to the door. “We are friends, Badri, go into any other business and I’ll continue to support you. But if you stay in television, you will be my enemy.” ([Location 1934](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=1934))

- He had published an open letter in his newspaper, Kommersant, detailing Putin’s attack, as he saw it—outlining how the president and the government had demanded that the businessman give up his legally owned shares in ORT or face destruction. In the letter he had demanded that the government should instead give up its own holding in the television station, that Russia needed a truly free press, and that Putin’s efforts against him were part of an overall effort to take control of all the media in the country. ([Location 1948](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=1948))

- It’s a hard winter, when one wolf eats another. —OLD RUSSIAN PROVERB ([Location 1992](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=1992))

- Abramovich may have believed he was acting in all of their best interests, but as Berezovsky saw it, Abramovich had decided that Berezovsky was a threat to his business, a heavy weight hanging around his neck, and he was going to free himself by taking Berezovsky out of the equation, shoveling him off into his quiet exile. Putin was the future, and for Abramovich to continue to thrive in Russia, he needed to be at peace with the Kremlin. Which meant drawing a line between him and his former mentor. ([Location 2086](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=2086))

- A krysha in exile wasn’t a krysha anymore—he was a liability. ([Location 2103](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=2103))

- Once Litvinenko arrived in London, Berezovsky, who had also moved there, had taken over arrangements. Without any prodding, the Oligarch had set up Litvinenko and his family in an apartment in Kensington, renting him a flat that might not have been luxurious, but compared nicely to his old apartment in Moscow. Kensington itself was a sparkling, upper-class corner of London, bordered by the same gardens that now splayed out behind him, and right up next to the center of the bustling city. Berezovsky’s largesse hadn’t ended there; the Oligarch was also providing Litvinenko with a salary of five thousand pounds a month. His job description hadn’t ever been spelled out, but the way he saw it, he was essentially an “associate on call”; if Berezovsky ever needed his particular skill set, he would be available, no questions asked. ([Location 2131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=2131))

- After all, Khodorkovsky wasn’t the richest man in Russia by accident. He had built his empire from nothing, in banking, oil—God only knew what else—and in the process had become one of the most well-known names in the country. That he was now on the government’s shit list, for challenging the new regime at every step, meant little to the two men at the airplane’s controls. ([Location 2268](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=2268))

- Fortunately for the Oligarch, not only had Berezovksy prevailed in court again and again—rubber mask and all—but just a week ago, he had been granted official political asylum in the UK. Rumors abounded that he had been turning over information to the British Secret Service in return for their protection, and he certainly liked the implications. Given how often he had been appearing in the British press, he felt once again that he had become a very important man. In the West, things were different; politics seemed secondary to money. And, at the moment, he had plenty of money to spend. ([Location 2317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=2317))

- Of course, his yacht was nothing compared to Abramovich’s—one of which was over 377 feet long, with a pair of helicopter pads and a huge swimming pool that turned into a dance floor. Nor could his real estate compare to his former protégé’s—Abramovich was building a one-hundred-million-dollar palace in St. Barths and combining a block of apartments in Belgravia that could one day be worth twice that. Berezovsky might have a private jet, but Abramovich had a 767. And Abramovich had recently made the ultimate purchase, the storied Chelsea Football Club, probably worth over a billion dollars on its own. ([Location 2326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=2326))

- Badri, a much less ostentatious man by nature, had been using his money much differently. While he had put some of it into investments such as the Buddha Bar in New York, he had made his primary home in Georgia, the ex-Russian province of his birth, rather than in England or the United States. Berezovsky had pushed his friend into politics in the breakaway territory—using some of his own money to help Badri fund the Rose Revolution, which had put one of Badri’s friends and colleagues—and a democratic, liberalizing influence—Mikheil Saakashvili, a pro-West candidate who was only thirty-six, into the Georgian presidency. ([Location 2334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=2334))

- In general, the years since Litvinenko had made London his home had been busy. Agitating, as his friend Berezovsky liked to say, was a full-time job. Litvinenko had written or cowritten a pair of books attacking Putin, had met numerous contacts among like-minded revolutionaries, and he always had his eyes open to try to find more ways to use his particular skills for profit or ex-pat politics. ([Location 2387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=2387))

- Litvinenko had pushed the entire agency’s buttons by his whistle-blowing, and his actions since he had come to London hadn’t helped matters at all. He had made many open accusations against the FSB and Putin personally, even once going so far as to call the president a pedophile. Litvinenko would’ve been surprised if there weren’t people in Russia who wanted to do him harm. ([Location 2400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T5H3XRG&location=2400))

- It wasn’t until yesterday, November 22, that his samples had finally made their way to the British Atomic Weapons Establishment—a military lab specializing in combating nuclear terrorism.
