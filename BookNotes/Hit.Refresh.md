### Highlights

- “Our industry does not respect tradition. What it respects is innovation. ([Location 1091](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HOT5SQA&location=1091))
- One of my favorite books is Tracy Kidder’s The Soul of a New Machine about another tech company, Data General, in the 1970s. In it, Kidder teaches us that technology is nothing more than the collective soul of those who build it. ([Location 1095](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HOT5SQA&location=1095))
- Steve Jobs understood what the soul of a company is. He once said that “design is the fundamental soul of a man-made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product or service.” ([Location 1101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HOT5SQA&location=1101))
- My approach is to lead with a sense of purpose and pride in what we do, not envy or combativeness. ([Location 1126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HOT5SQA&location=1126))
- Buying a company with weak market share is always risky. What we needed most was a fresh and distinctive approach to mobile computing. ([Location 1153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HOT5SQA&location=1153))
- I think of culture as a complex system made up of individual mindsets—the mindsets of those in front of me. Culture is how an organization thinks and acts, but individuals shape it. ([Location 1389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HOT5SQA&location=1389))
- We learn about our customers and their businesses with a beginner’s mind and then bring them solutions that meet their needs. We need to be insatiable in our desire to learn from the outside and bring that learning into Microsoft, while still innovating to surprise and delight our users. ([Location 1491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HOT5SQA&location=1491))
- I tell my colleagues they get to own a customer scenario, not the code. Our code may need to be tailored one way for a small business and another way for a public-sector customer. It’s our ability to work together that makes our dreams believable and, ultimately, achievable. We must learn to build on the ideas of others and collaborate across boundaries to bring the best of Microsoft to our customers as one—one Microsoft. ([Location 1505](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HOT5SQA&location=1505))
- When I learn about a shortcoming, it’s a thrilling moment. The person who points it out has given me the gift of insight. ([Location 1540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HOT5SQA&location=1540))
- Culture change is hard. It can be painful. The fundamental source of resistance to change is fear of the unknown. Really big questions for which there are no certain answers can be scary. ([Location 1604](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HOT5SQA&location=1604))
- I must work hard—not to climb the ladder, but to do important work. ([Location 1674](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HOT5SQA&location=1674))
- I told these high-potential leaders that once you become a vice president, a partner in this endeavor, the whining is over. You can’t say the coffee around here is bad, or there aren’t enough good people, or I didn’t get the bonus. “To be a leader in this company, your job is to find the rose petals in a field of shit.” ([Location 1709](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HOT5SQA&location=1709))
- And we want Microsoft to be their partner. To do so, there are four initiatives every company must make a priority. The first is engaging their customer base by leveraging data to improve the customer experience. Second, they must empower their own employees by enabling greater and more mobile productivity and collaboration in the new digital world of work. Third, they must optimize operations, automating and simplifying business processes across sales, operations, and finance. Fourth, they must transform their products, services, and business models. ([Location 1805](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HOT5SQA&location=1805))
- Every company is becoming a digital company, and that process begins with infusing their products with intelligence. ([Location 1809](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HOT5SQA&location=1809))
- Rolls-Royce is designing their engines as big-data platforms to predict failures and minimize breakdowns. ([Location 1814](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HOT5SQA&location=1814))
- “He who has a ‘why’ to live for can bear almost any ‘how.’” ([Location 2068](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HOT5SQA&location=2068))
- E + SV + SR = T/t Empathy + Shared values + Safety and Reliability = Trust over time ([Location 2492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HOT5SQA&location=2492))
- They recommend, and I agree, that we business leaders must replace our labor-saving and automation mindset with a maker and creation mindset. ([Location 2816](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HOT5SQA&location=2816))
- First, we invent and design the technologies of transformation, which is where we are today. Second, we retrofit for the future. We’ll be entering this phase shortly. For example, drone pilots will need training; conversion of traditional cars into autonomous vehicles will require redesign and rebuilding. ([Location 2828](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HOT5SQA&location=2828))
- They want Silicon Valley satellites. Instead, they should be working on plans to make the best technologies available to local entrepreneurs so that they can organically grow more jobs at home—not just in high-tech industries but in every economic sector. ([Location 2891](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HOT5SQA&location=2891))
- The most profound difference between leaders is whether they fear or embrace new technology. It’s a difference that can determine the trajectory of a nation’s economy. ([Location 2895](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HOT5SQA&location=2895))
- By contrast, industrial productivity in Spain significantly lagged the rest of Europe as a result of Spain’s slow adoption of outside innovations and protectionist policies that decreased its global competitiveness. ([Location 2901](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HOT5SQA&location=2901))
- Based on this analysis, Comin agrees that differences between rich and poor nations can largely be explained by the speed at which they adopted industrial technologies. ([Location 2921](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HOT5SQA&location=2921))
- “Although automation tends to reduce employment and the share of labor in national income, the creation of more complex tasks has the opposite effect.” ([Location 3106](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HOT5SQA&location=3106))
