### Highlights

- "There is a remarkably close parallel between the problems of the physicist and those of the cryptographer. The system on which a message is enciphered corresponds to the laws of the uni-verse, the intertepted messages to the evidence available, the keys for a day or a message to important constants which have to be determined.
The correspondence is very close, but the subject matter of cryptography is very easily dealt with by discrete machinery, physics not so easily." - Alan Turing
