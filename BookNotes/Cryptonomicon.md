### Highlights

- "There is a remarkably close parallel between the problems of the physicist and those of the cryptographer. The system on which a message is enciphered corresponds to the laws of the universe, the intercepted messages to the evidence available, the keys for a day or a message to important constants which have to be determined. The correspondence is very close, but the subject matter of cryptography is very easily dealt with by discrete machinery, physics not so easily." - Alan Turing

- If you want your secrets to remain secret past the end of your life expectancy, then, in order to choose a key length, you have to be a futurist. You have to anticipate how much faster computers will get during this time. You must also be a student of politics. Because if the entire world were to become a police state obsessed with recovering old secrets, then vast resources might be thrown at the problem of factoring large composite numbers.

- Ah, the morphine. It can't be too bad of a nightmare if it comes with morphine, can it?

- There might be wildness, there might be deep forest, there might even be grizzly bears and mountain lions, but it is cleanly sorted out, and the rules (don't mess with bear cubs, hang your food from a tree limb at night) are well-known, ad published in the Boy Scout Manual. In those Pacific islands there is so much that is alive, and all of it is in a continual process of eating and being eaten by something else, and once you set foot in the place, you're buying into the deal.

- "In business, people rarely plan to do a thing only once," Randy says. "It messes up the spreadsheets."

- One thing Waterhouse likes about these Brits is that when they they don’t know what the hell you are talking about, they are at least open to be possibility that it might be their fault.

- War is hell, but smoking cigarettes makes it all worthwhile.

- "You know how it works," Avi says. "When you go to the dentist, you never actually see the dentist, right? Someone else makes the appointment. Then there's always this elite coterie of highly efficient women who scrape the plaque out of the way, so that the dentist doesn't have to deal with it, and take your X-rays. The dentist himself sits in the back somewhere and looks at the X-rays he deals with you as this abstract greyscale image on a little piece of film. If he sees holes, he goes into action. If not, he comes in and exchanges small talk with you for a minute and then you go home". "So, why is he here?" demands Eberhard Föhr. "Exactly!" Avi says. "When he walks into the room, you never know why he's here to drill a hole in your skull, or just talk about his vacation in Maui."

- His feeling of disappointment that accompanies this action has nothing to do with the contents of the safe. He is disappointed because he has solved the problem, and has gone back to the baseline state of boredom and low-level irritation that always comes over him when he's not doing something that inherently needs to be done, like picking a lock or breaking a code.

- "Just remember that, at the end of the day, we're back in the hotel, and the sultan is still here, and al of this is just a memory to us. The fact that the sultan has a big garden has no relevance to anything."

- "I hate e-mail," John says. Harvard Li stares him in the eye for a while. "What do you mean?" "The concept is good. The execution is poor. People don't observe any security precautions. A message arrives claiming to be from Havard Li, they believe it's really from Harvard Li. But this message is just a pattern of magnetized spots on a spinning disk somewhere. Anyone could forge it." "Ah. You use digital signature algorithm." John considers this carefully. "I do not respond to any e-mail that s not digitally signed. Digital signature algorithm refers to one technique for signing them. It is a good technique, but it could be better."

- "I know you're expecting me to ask for morphine, but I'm not gonna," Shaftoe says. "I just want to talk." "Oh," Root says. "Should I put on my chaplain hat, then?" "I'm a fucking Protestant. I can talk to God myself whenever I goddamn well feel like it."

- "How's the cable business" she mutters. Months ago, she gave up even trying to hide her scorn for the dull work of cable-laying. Pretenses are shabby things that, like papier-mâché houses, must be energetically maintained or they will dissolve.

- But there is something that he could be doing. This is why laptop were invented, so that important business persons would not fritter away long flights relaxing.

- Since most hackers are white males, their companies are disaster areas when it comes to diversity, and it follows that all of the diversity must be concentrated in the one or two employees who are not hackers.

- Give those Finns a grim, stark, bleak moral dilemma and a bottle of schnapps and you could pretty much forget about them for forty-eight hours.

- "Someone pour that man a cup of coffee!" Comstock orders. Someone does. Being in the military is amazing; you give orders, and things happen.

- Waterhouse frowns at the coffee mug. "Well, it's all math," he says. "If the math works, why then you should be sure of yourself. That's the whole point of math."
