### Highlights

- "There is a remarkably close parallel between the problems of the physicist and those of the cryptographer. The system on which a message is enciphered corresponds to the laws of the universe, the intercepted messages to the evidence available, the keys for a day or a message to important constants which have to be determined. The correspondence is very close, but the subject matter of cryptography is very easily dealt with by discrete machinery, physics not so easily." - Alan Turing

- If you want your secrets to remain secret past the end of your life expectancy, then, in order to choose a key length, you have to be a futurist. You have to anticipate how much faster computers will get during this time. You must also be a student of politics. Because if the entire world were to become a police state obsessed with recovering old secrets, then vast resources might be thrown at the problem of factoring large composite numbers.

- Ah, the morphine. It can't be too bad of a nightmare if it comes with morphine, can it?

- There might be wildness, there might be deep forest, there might even be grizzly bears and mountain lions, but it is cleanly sorted out, and the rules (don't mess with bear cubs, hang your food from a tree limb at night) are well-known, ad published in the Boy Scout Manual. In those Pacific islands there is so much that is alive, and all of it is in a continual process of eating and being eaten by something else, and once you set foot in the place, you're buying into the deal.

- "In business, people rarely plan to do a thing only once," Randy says. "It messes up the spreadsheets."

- One thing Waterhouse likes about these Brits is that when they they don’t know what the hell you are talking about, they are at least open to be possibility that it might be their fault.

- War is hell, but smoking cigarettes makes it all worthwhile.

- "You know how it works," Avi says. "When you go to the dentist, you never actually see the dentist, right? Someone else makes the appointment. Then there's always this elite coterie of highly efficient women who scrape the plaque out of the way, so that the dentist doesn't have to deal with it, and take your X-rays. The dentist himself sits in the back somewhere and looks at the X-rays he deals with you as this abstract greyscale image on a little piece of film. If he sees holes, he goes into action. If not, he comes in and exchanges small talk with you for a minute and then you go home". "So, why is he here?" demands Eberhard Föhr. "Exactly!" Avi says. "When he walks into the room, you never know why he's here to drill a hole in your skull, or just talk about his vacation in Maui."

- His feeling of disappointment that accompanies this action has nothing to do with the contents of the safe. He is disappointed because he has solved the problem, and has gone back to the baseline state of boredom and low-level irritation that always comes over him when he's not doing something that inherently needs to be done, like picking a lock or breaking a code.

- "Just remember that, at the end of the day, we're back in the hotel, and the sultan is still here, and al of this is just a memory to us. The fact that the sultan has a big garden has no relevance to anything."

- "I hate e-mail," John says. Harvard Li stares him in the eye for a while. "What do you mean?" "The concept is good. The execution is poor. People don't observe any security precautions. A message arrives claiming to be from Havard Li, they believe it's really from Harvard Li. But this message is just a pattern of magnetized spots on a spinning disk somewhere. Anyone could forge it." "Ah. You use digital signature algorithm." John considers this carefully. "I do not respond to any e-mail that s not digitally signed. Digital signature algorithm refers to one technique for signing them. It is a good technique, but it could be better."

- "I know you're expecting me to ask for morphine, but I'm not gonna," Shaftoe says. "I just want to talk." "Oh," Root says. "Should I put on my chaplain hat, then?" "I'm a fucking Protestant. I can talk to God myself whenever I goddamn well feel like it."

- "How's the cable business" she mutters. Months ago, she gave up even trying to hide her scorn for the dull work of cable-laying. Pretenses are shabby things that, like papier-mâché houses, must be energetically maintained or they will dissolve.

- But there is something that he could be doing. This is why laptop were invented, so that important business persons would not fritter away long flights relaxing.

- Since most hackers are white males, their companies are disaster areas when it comes to diversity, and it follows that all of the diversity must be concentrated in the one or two employees who are not hackers.

- Give those Finns a grim, stark, bleak moral dilemma and a bottle of schnapps and you could pretty much forget about them for forty-eight hours.

- "Someone pour that man a cup of coffee!" Comstock orders. Someone does. Being in the military is amazing; you give orders, and things happen.

- Waterhouse frowns at the coffee mug. "Well, it's all math," he says. "If the math works, why then you should be sure of yourself. That's the whole point of math."

- Chester nods all the way through this, but does not rudely interrupt Randy as a younger nerd would. Your younger nerd takes offense quickly when someone near him begins to utter declarative sentences, because he reads into it an assertion that he, the nerd, does not already know the information being imparted. But your older nerd has more self-confidence, and besides, understands that frequently people need to think out loud. And highly advanced nerds will furthermore understand that uttering declarative sentences whose contents are already known to all present is part of the social process of making conversation and therefore should not be construed as aggression under any circumstances.

- All of these countries are burning resources at a fantastic rate to get their economies stoked up, gambling that they'll be able to make the jump into hyperspace  - some kind of knowledge economy, presumably -before they run out of stuff to sell and turn into Haiti.

- Crypto experts won't trust a cryptosystem until they have attacked it, and they can't attack it until they know the basic cryptanalytical techniques, and hence the demand for a document lite this modern, annotated version of the Cryptonomicon.

- Intuition, like a flash of lightning, lasts only for a second. It generally comes when one is tormented by a difficult decipherment and when one reviews in his mind the fruitless experiments already tried. Suddenly the light breaks through and one finds after a few minutes what previous days of labor were unable to reveal.

- As with anything else under UNIX (of which Finux is a variant), there are a million options that only young, lonely, or obsessed people have the time and patience to explore. Randy has been all three at various times of his life and knows a lot about these options.

- "Now keep in mind that the typical Greek myth goes something like this: innocent shepherd boy is minding his own business, an overflying god spies him and gets a hard-on, swoops down and rapes him silly; while the victim is still staggering around in a daze, that god's wife or lover, in a jealous rage, turns him--the helpless, innocent victim, that is-into let's say an immortal turtle and e.g. power-staples him to a sheet of plywood with a dish of turtle food just out of his reach and leaves him out in the sun forever to be repeatedly disemboweled by army ants and stung by hornets or something. So if Arachne had dissed anyone else in the Pantheon, she would have been just a smoking hole in the ground before she knew what hit her."

- Randy is mounting a known-ciphertext attack: the hardest kind. He has the ciphertext (the Arethusa intercepts) and nothing else. He doesn't even know the algorithm that was used to encrypt them. In modern cryptanalysis, this is unusual; normally the algorithms are public knowledge. That is because algorithms that have been openly discussed and  attacked within the academic community tend to be much stronger than they were ones that have been kept secret. People who rely on keeping their algorithms secret are ruined as soon as that secret gets out.

- Trust goes a long way, but at some point, if you're going to sponsor a stable currency, you must put up or shut up.

- That's all those guys can talk about, is mowing the lawn. But when they get back home, will they want to mow the lawn?"
"No." "Right. They only talk like that because mowing the lawn sounds great when you're sitting in a foxhole picking lice off your nuts."
