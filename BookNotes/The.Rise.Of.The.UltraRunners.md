### Highlights

- A tranquil harmony reigned over the camp that day after the final stage. Did we just suddenly forget the pain and the suffering? Or was the suffering part of why we were happy?

- abcd

- If happiness wasn’t in comfort, was it somehow to be found in being uncomfortable? Was there some need for those of us with no suffering in our lives, to find some? Because it made us appreciate our homes and our comforts more? Or did suffering a little somehow make us stronger, more fulfilled human beings?

- Her decision to delve into ultra running was accelerated by some unexpected life events. Within a short span of time her father died, her mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, and her husband got cancer. ‘All of those things,’ she says, ‘make you realise that life is very short, and you just have to do it, you can’t sit and wait.’

- I remember being struck by a photograph I saw of the Spanish ultra athlete Azara García, who has a tattoo on her leg that reads (in Spanish): The Devil whispered in my ear: ‘You’re not strong enough to withstand the storm.’ I whispered back: ‘I am the storm.’

- It is a big, unwieldy thing to get my head around, a sport morphing in many directions at once. With no central overseeing body or organisation, the races, interest groups, and self-appointed guardians of ultra running jostle and fight for control and for a cut of the increasing amounts of money sloshing around. It’s a Wild West of a sport, still untamed, with many of the original prospectors fiercely protective of it, pushing back against the encroachment of ‘brands’ and ‘outsiders’—people, they feel, who don’t understand the ethos of the sport. For many, part of the appeal of ultra running is its low-key, ‘Into the Wild’ minimalism, a chance to lose yourself in the wilderness, to cross the toughest, most extreme environments on Earth with little more than a flask of water and a rain jacket.

- For some seasoned ultra runners, the influx of newcomers is already too much, and they are turning their backs on the big races in search of more isolated challenges. One outlet for these people, who hate mass starts and goody bags even more than a long night of hypothermia clinging to the side of a frozen rock face, is another growing phenomenon called FKTs (Fastest Known Times). This is where people head off, often alone, to run a set route faster than anyone ever (knowingly) has before. It could be from one end of New Zealand to the other, or a famous hiking trail such as the Appalachian Trail in the United States. Or to the top of Mount Everest.

- The sport rose in popularity in part on the back of the exploits of an American named Edward Payson Weston. It all began when, in 1861, after losing a bet with a friend over the outcome of the 1860 presidential election, he was forced to walk the 478 miles from Boston to Washington, DC, in ten days, in an effort to make it in time to witness the inauguration of President Abraham Lincoln.

- Despite their brief moment in the sun, lapped ultra races on flat courses are today largely stuck in the back corner of the sport. Instead, the most popular, the most brightly lit branch of the sport, the one with the most bunting and the biggest stars is the mountain ultra trail running world. Here the titans of the sport, such as Kilian Jornet and Jim Walmsley, go head to head in races of up to 100 miles. Unlike Oman, these races are a one-time effort. The gun goes and the first one to the finish wins. No afternoons spent hanging out in Berber tents chatting with Dino. Just go, go, go until you get to the end.

- And the biggest race of all, the Super Bowl of mountain ultra trail running, is the Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc (UTMB). Each year in Chamonix in the French Alps, the cream of the ultra trail running world come together for the grand finale, the race of races. Win this and you’re guaranteed legend status in the sport.

- The UTMB is so popular that you can’t just enter, you have to first qualify, by running three other ultras designated as qualifying races. And even then, that only grants you entry into the race lottery—which gives you roughly a one in three chance of getting a place in the race. The UTMB has a list of races it considers qualifying races. The reasoning behind this seems to originally have been to make sure only serious and prepared runners turn up for the race. But this reasonable aim seems to have been lost somewhere along the way, and what is left is a highly contentious system. The issue many people have is that if you are a race director wishing to get your event on the UTMB’s list, you don’t have to pass any particular safety test or prove that your route is as tough and arduous as you say, or that you are scrupulous and trustworthy. No, you just have to pay them some money.

- One issue for runners wanting to take part in the UTMB has been races that have been on the list in previous years, but which then drop off when they fail, or refuse, to pay the annual fee, leaving runners who were expecting to gain the points to find out only after completing the race that they haven’t qualified after all.

- This came to a head when the Hardrock 100, one of the most famous ultra races in the United States, decided it was no longer going to pay to be a UTMB qualifying race. This was particularly pertinent because the biggest star in the sport, Kilian Jornet, a three-time winner of the UTMB, was counting on the points from running the Hardrock 100 for his UTMB entry. The UTMB’s rules clearly state that every athlete has to have the points, even the elite athletes, so when they saw that Hardrock had not paid up, ITRA emailed the organisers to politely suggest they cough up so Jornet could race in France. ‘We didn’t like the system and we felt it was a little distasteful,’ says David Coblentz, president of the board of directors at the Hardrock 100. ‘They don’t come and check out your course, you just send them a GPX file and they upload it to some algorithm and give you your points. It is really just another way to make money.’

- The whole furore reveals a lot about the state the sport is in as it grows so fast. Behind the beautiful Instagram accounts and the incredible feats of the runners, a gold rush is taking place, with prospectors jostling for power and control. As well as ITRA and the big races, multinational clothing and outdoor sports brands have moved in, staking out their ground by signing up the biggest events and the star athletes, producing slick advertising campaigns, with viral films of men and women racing across sumptuous landscapes, hurtling down fantastical precipices. Ultra running is still a largely untapped and unregulated market, and there are no signs of its growth slowing. So while the runners are out there digging their way deep into the pain cave, others see an open, unguarded door to a gold mine and are racing in to nail their nameplates to the walls.

- ‘Ultimately, the life I was living, where running and training had become something I had to do rather than something I wanted to do, led to an early, and short-lived, retirement,’ he tells me as I cook up a pasta surprise in our small cottage kitchen. ‘So when I started running again, and took up ultra running, I vowed I would only run because I loved it, and that love of running has been there ever since.’

- One of the most common things I’ve heard in my nascent investigation into ultra running is that it is basically ‘an eating competition with some running thrown in’.

- A number of studies have established that women are better at pacing themselves in races than men. Most of these studies only speculate about why this is, and suppose that it is men overestimating their abilities and going off too fast, while women tend to underplay their abilities. One study of finishers at the Houston Marathon confirmed this theory by comparing the final data with the runners’ own predicted finishing times. It concluded that poor pacing by men was ‘in part explained by [their] overconfidence’.

- ‘It’s always interesting to push your boundaries,’ she says. ‘If you always succeed you don’t know where your limits are.’

- The science behind cheating is fascinating and numerous studies across the years have found that most of us will cheat given the right circumstances and if the opportunity to get away with it presents itself. Many of the circumstances that scientists say make us more likely to cheat, such as being in the dark, being tired, and sleep deprived, are familiar to ultra runners.

- Dr Dan Ariely, of Duke University in North Carolina, says we will cheat if we can justify it to ourselves. In his book The Truth About Dishonesty, he says humans are storytelling creatures by nature, and that we will tell ourselves story after story until we come up with an explanation that sounds reasonable and believable.

- Cheating, psychologists say, is especially easy to justify when you frame situations to cast yourself as a victim of some kind of unfairness. Then it becomes a matter of evening the score; you’re not cheating, you’re restoring fairness.

- ‘People who say there’s no money in ultra running, so why would anyone cheat, aren’t thinking about it enough. A lot of people in our sport come from a decent background anyway. It’s ego and a form of laziness and impatience.’ He says the problem will only get worse in the future. ‘More money, more “fame”, that Instagram lifestyle, more pressure from sponsors. All that is growing. And people in the sport are getting faster, so weak people will make excuses. We have people who have been banned previously but it seems to have been forgotten.’

- In elite ultra trail running there are, broadly speaking, two main domains: Europe and the United States. In Europe, the trails are considered rough and technical, and are dominated by mountain men, Alpinists such as Kilian Jornet and François D’Haene. In the United States, the trails tend to be smoother, more runnable, and the scene here is slowly being taken over by a bunch of young stars with a background in track or road running, guys like Jim Walmsley and women like former US Olympic marathon runner Magda Boulet.

- But here is Zach in the North Face 50, well clear of everyone else, heading for an impressive victory, but still running like his life is in danger, his arms pumping, his breathing hard, guttural. He keeps it up right to the line before collapsing into the arms of his girlfriend. It’s this all-or-nothing approach he brings to his racing as much as his victories that has made Zach such an admired figure in the sport, and I’m expecting to meet a brash, high-energy jock with a Superman handshake. Someone who can’t stop talking and moving around. Instead he speaks with a slow, easy drawl and seems a little shy if anything. He says he is cooking burritos, if I want some.

- ‘My agent said your value is whatever you can get a company to pay you. That’s how it works. In other jobs or even in other sports you usually know what your worth is. If you win a certain tournament or something, that’s worth so much. But in ultra running there are no set parameters, there’s no set list that says that since you won this and that race we’ll pay you this much.’ Value to a sponsor is not easily defined in this evolving sport, but being a viral sensation known for your gutsy running style certainly helps. Zach says that for the first time, with this new contract, he doesn’t really need to work outside running.

- Times people once thought were untouchable are being smashed by the likes of Kilian Jornet and Jim Walmsley. But the Pikes Peak record remains a rare exception. In 1993, local runner Matt Carpenter raced up and down the mountain in 3hrs 16mins. It was the third of his twelve wins, and it remains the course record. ‘He’s the king of this mountain,’ says Zach. Last year, the world mountain running champion Joseph Gray ran just the ascent and got as close as anyone ever has to one of Carpenter’s Pikes Peak records. But he was still four minutes off. In 2012, Jornet had a go at the marathon, but was almost 25 minutes off Carpenter’s time.

- Zach is clearly in awe of Carpenter, and I can’t help smiling at the idea of one of the greatest mountain runners that ever lived—he also still holds the course record at the famous Leadville 100 ultra marathon—serving ice cream in a little shop in Colorado.

- He tells me about the time when the camp was so busy that he didn’t manage to get his run in, so he decided to run to the Pikes Peak summit at two o’clock in the morning. He says he enjoyed it so much, he went up again the next night. And the next. ‘I ended up doing it seven nights in a row,’ he says. ‘I don’t know why, I just felt like it.’ Before I leave, later that day, back to civilisation, I ask Zach what it is that motivates him to run. It can be a difficult question for any runner. ‘It’s the closest we can get to flying,’ he says. ‘I didn’t say that, someone else did, but I like it. I love the feeling of running.’ But it’s not only that. I sense something more altruistic in Zach, as though his running is part of something bigger. ‘Right,’ he says. ‘I believe people identify with watching someone who’s really trying their best, someone who’s struggling but is still trying to push as hard as they can.’

- Ultra running can be a metaphor for life, with all its ups and downs, its struggles and revivals. And when someone is good at it, and they run with their heart, with the sweat and the effort written across their face, the rest of us can connect with that. It stirs something in us. ‘There’s a lot to be said in life for just giving your all,’ says Zach. ‘I think a display of that in sport is really cool, because people can be inspired, and whether it motivates them to run or go out and work their office job really hard, it’s a human thing that people connect with. It’s doing your best.’

- Zach is the embodiment of the honest toil of ultra running. He lives in a hut in the woods and chops wood instead of going to the gym. He doesn’t use Strava or wear a fancy GPS, but runs with a five-dollar Casio watch he bought in a market in Portugal. Before that he used to run using the clock on the wall at Barr Camp. He would go out and run, and only look at the time when he got back. If the clock on the wall said only two hours had gone by, he would go back out and run some more. When he races, he eschews tactics and strategy, pushing himself as hard as he can for as long as he can. It’s reckless and it can leave him broken, even when he wins. But it is inspiring. It is the heart triumphing over the mind. And for that, everyone who has seen him run, in all those YouTube videos, finds themselves rooting for him.

- I ask him what drives him on to continue running, even now after his accident. ‘I love being outdoors, in the hills,’ he says. ‘It gives me a lot of energy and fulfilment.’ The pull to be out there running must be strong for someone to keep doing it even after they lose a leg. Someone who was once driven by competition, trying to win. But for Dave, like Zach, running clearly transcends simply the act of moving, racing, being in a state of flow. ‘Adventure is a big part of it,’ he adds. ‘Exploring, and experiencing the everyday changes in the mountains. Being out with friends, too. I guess the rewards are still too great to stop.’

- Young, fast, and good-looking, Sage is a hit on social media, with a huge following for his video blog in which he talks about his training, his races, his diet, and shares tips and advice. This is all a big draw for sponsors, and Sage, along with his coaching, has managed to make ultra running his career. Despite winning races, he says prize money doesn’t really count for much, unlike in marathons. ‘There’s no prize money at Western States,’ he says. ‘But a win could be worth thousands of dollars in bonus money and a new sponsorship that could change your whole career.’ It’s the same for the UTMB, he says. ‘The first American man to win at UTMB, well it would be worth a nice contract extension, extra salary, maybe a $ 10,000 bonus.’

- ‘Mike Wardian [a fellow ultra runner] told me, “they’re going to draw your blood the day before UTMB, just so you know”,’ he explains. ‘Everyone knows it’s coming. But EPO is something you would take in the months leading into the race when you’re doing the big training, and then a week before, you just taper off and you don’t get caught. Only an idiot would come into the race glowing with EPO.’

- One person from New Mexico says: ‘If I can go from a fat alcoholic to a fit endurance runner, anyone can do it. But I won’t lie, though, the attaboys from my friends and family certainly are encouraging.’

- For some people, social media has even helped them to keep running during a race. Helen James from the United Kingdom says that while she wouldn’t do a race simply to brag about it online, a few times she has been in a race and considered stopping, but the thought ‘How will it look on Facebook?’ made her continue.

- Ultra running coach Ryan Knapp believes online bragging plays a ‘massive’ role in the popularity of the sport. ‘Ultra is the new marathon,’ he says. ‘People like to be a martyr. They want to go out and talk about how “epic” it was, or how they finished with four broken legs, a fractured spine. It makes for a better story than “I ran well and finished pretty good”.’

- For all its pitfalls, social media has helped some of the top runners like Sage Canaday to forge a career out of the sport. ‘When I switched over from road running to ultras,’ he says, ‘my social media channels just grew exponentially. You get way more interest when you do ultras. If you’re just another 2: 16 road runner in the US, no one really cares.’

- More recently, Denver-based Courtney Dauwalter won the Moab 240 ultra race outright, beating the first male finisher by over 10 hours. Ultra running is certainly one of the sports where women come closest to competing equally with men at the sharp end—which only makes it all the more baffling that their efforts are not equally rewarded.

- There are examples of ultra runners with a difficult past everywhere. The fastest ultra runner in the United States right now, Jim Walmsley, started running after being discharged from the army, where he had been working 24-hour shifts as a nuclear missileer in an underground bunker. Although he had been a strong runner in college, he only took the sport up again to help him deal with the depression that followed his discharge. When I finally catch up with him, at the UTMB, he smiles thinking back on it. He’s now a champion ultra runner, with sponsors and fans, and a cool, relaxed manner. ‘Looking back, getting discharged was the best thing that ever happened to me,’ he says.

- Apparently marijuana, which is legal in California, is a good recovery tool for ultra runners, and Dunlap used to have a business supplying it. ‘The best way to get over an ultra is to kick back on the sofa, take a few edibles, and stick on all six Star Wars movies,’ he says, grinning so much I can’t tell if he’s messing with me. I don’t think he is. ‘Isn’t that technically doping?’ ‘It would show up in a test, sure. But I know some of those top guys are taking Ibuprofen in races every two hours. That’s doping. Do I have any ethical qualms about using pot? The next race I’m doing, they hand out marijuana from mile 50. So it’s up to the race director, that’s how I see it. If it’s a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) compliant race, then I’ll abide by the rules.’

- ‘Tell him about the Brit,’ says Gary. Scott nods, like he’s just getting to it. ‘I ended up being sponsored by Inov-8 shoes. I was introduced to them by a Brit, Robert Brown, who was a talented fell runner and also a pilot for British Airways. He was doing the London–San Francisco route, and would often come to the local trail races and kick our butts. I invited him to sleep on my couch. He had these crazy shoes, and so he brought me a pair, and I loved them. Later when Inov-8 came to the US, they saw I was already in their shoes and added me to their elite team. Robert Brown, it turns out, was later convicted of killing his wife and burying her in the backyard.’

- Ultra runners also like to talk about conquering the mountains. It’s you versus the mountain, they say. I look at it. But the mountain is unmoved. As I struggle along its grassy trail, it stands there serene, impassive. The mountain isn’t fighting me back, and I have no truck with the mountain. We could just as easily lie down together and be friends.

- the Comrades Marathon, the biggest and the oldest ultra marathon in the world. Billing itself as The Greatest Human Race, Comrades fails to fit into any of ultra running’s main boxes. Despite being a 56-mile road race, its appeal, at least in this corner of the world, far outstrips any other ultra race. Even the UTMB can’t match the history, the scale, and the sense of occasion of the Comrades Marathon.

- The Comrades Marathon was first run in 1921 and was the brainchild of First World War veteran Vic Clapham. Struggling to readjust to life after returning from the war, and missing the camaraderie of his fellow troops, Clapham came up with the idea of a race between his home town of Pietermaritzburg and the city of Durban on the coast, a distance of around 56 miles.

- Ultra running, despite its huge global growth, is still a niche sport. Except here in South Africa, where this road ultra marathon is quite simply the biggest sporting event of the year. The peak in the race’s numbers came in a special millennium edition in 2000, when the final cut-off time was extended from eleven to twelve hours and over twenty thousand runners took part.

- ‘Run the kilometre you’re in. Don’t worry about how many you have left, just run this one,’ our leader tells us. It’s good advice.

- Camille is known for her unorthodox running style—she barely lifts her legs and looks more like she’s cross-country skiing than running, or like someone doing the twist on roller skates. ‘My gait is different,’ she says. ‘I was born with my right femur anteverted—twisted inwards. Basically I was born with a not perfect body.’ She says it meant her gait was asymmetrical, so she had to adapt her stride to put less force and stress on the body. ‘So I developed this shuffle where I lift off the ground rather than push off it. It’s not fast or powerful. I’m probably the slowest 5K runner who can run a sub-2: 40 marathon. But for ultras . . . it’s like I’m skimming off the ground.

- Camille, determined to fix her injury problems, studied physiology and wrote her masters thesis on bone recovery. ‘My parents say my greatest strength is my mind, because I apply science to being a better athlete. I read The Self-Made Olympian by Ron Daws . . . this guy was not super talented, but he worked very hard and was very methodical.’ The result of her methodical approach is that she has now run over 100 miles every week for eleven consecutive years, with no injuries.

- Neuroscience says you can tape two fingers together and within two hours the brain will start to reconfigure it as one finger instead of two. That’s in two hours.

- I decide to wander back outside to watch the people still finishing. I’m feeling a little better now. It seems like everyone except me has a support crew. I didn’t think there was much point. They would just have to travel around the island, standing in the cold for hours just to watch me go by for a few seconds. This was my own thing, my own project, it’s not really benefiting anyone or achieving anything meaningful. It felt a bit egotistical to expect someone to follow me around like a personal assistant for three days.

- But like an ambush from out of the hedges, I was suddenly overwhelmed by negative thoughts, asking what the point of it all was, ultra running, the UTMB, and its stupid race points. I actually stepped back, in my head, and watched the comments flooding in over the walls, and I laughed to myself. Am I going to do this in every race? Does there always have to be some sort of existential crisis? Come on, I told myself, brandishing my sword of reason. Don’t do this a mile from the finish.

- I kept this card with me. I took it out. It was a quote by Confucius: “Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.”

- Soon after leaving Aberffraw, as it’s still getting light, we run past a tiny beach. Big waves are crashing in, and as we run through the car park a man stands by his car pulling on a wetsuit, preparing to go surfing. He looks at us in amazement as silently, one after the other, like ghosts we shuffle by, with our rucksacks and our pained expressions. I catch his eye. ‘I thought I was the mad one,’ he says. And at that point, all I can think is that he’s right. I can’t see the joy, the satisfaction, anything other than insanity in running for a third day around this Welsh island, in this weather, with a bunch of people I don’t even know. It doesn’t make sense. But I press on.

- Running further back in the field, at this slower pace, things are different. Rather than trying to catch people, pass them, stay ahead, rush, rush, rush, I can take my time and experience the journey. If I had done the whole race like this, perhaps I could have enjoyed it. Why do I always have to race the whole time? I could just be taking it in, enjoying the scenery, the atmosphere, the company of my fellow runners. This is my place. I did the first two days too fast. Here, at the back, I’m happy. But then, after a while, I start thinking that we’re walking too much. I’m here to run.

- In the immortal words of Alabama 3: ‘There ain’t nothing worse than some fool lying on some third world beach wearing spandex, psychedelic trousers, smoking damn dope and pretending he’s getting consciousness expansion. If I want consciousness expansion, I go to my local tabernacle and I sing.’ Or I go to my local track and I run.

- As I mingled with the runners afterwards, poking my nose into their post-race exultation, I came across 76-year-old Pat sitting in the front seat of her car peeling plasters off her toes. I asked her how it had been. ‘I hallucinated, of course. I always do,’ she said, chucking the plasters in the footwell of the car. ‘Although usually I run with my friend and we take turns to hallucinate.’ Pat was the oldest competitor in the race. She had just run 84 miles, but she was not about to blow her own trumpet. ‘It’s not that great,’ she said. ‘Last year I ran 87.’ For Pat, this was all completely run of the mill. As well as countless 24-hour races, she had run 456 marathons, and counting. And she didn’t even start running until her late forties. ‘It keeps me busy,’ she said, when I asked her why she did it. ‘What else am I going to do on a Saturday?’

- I did spend a weekend with the British 24-hour running squad. The lowly status of 24-hour running is illustrated by the fact that the national team held their training weekend in a youth hostel in Berkshire. We slept in bunk beds, six men to a room, and each member of the team paid his own way.

- Robbie Britton, the team captain, who came third in the recent 24-hour World Championships, told me that the key to 24-hour running was to stay in the moment. ‘I mentally just tell myself to run for one hour,’ he said. ‘Even when I’m absolutely shattered, I know I can run for an hour, so I just do that. Then I think about the next one.’

- The mind can throw seemingly indisputable arguments and reasoning at you. And even more than that, it can create real, actual pain in your legs, or at least the sensation of it. Yet, with a change of perspective, such as realising you are close to the finish, or being moved by the incredible effort of others, or even reading an inspirational quote, the pain can evaporate. It may or may not be real, but it is not debilitating.

- As the spiritual teacher Eckhart Tolle says: ‘As soon as you honour the present moment, all unhappiness and struggle dissolve, and life begins to flow with joy and ease.’

- At twenty-nine, Jornet has won virtually everything in the sport. His backstory is the stuff of legend. Born in a mountain hut in the Spanish Pyrenees—his dad was a mountain guide—by five years old he had already climbed Aneto, the highest mountain in the Pyrenees. His first love was ski-mountaineering, a sport involving climbing or skiing up mountains and skiing back down, and he competed internationally, winning some world championship races. When he was just eighteen, he took up mountain running, and in 2008 he claimed the first of his three UTMB wins at the age of twenty-one. He has also won the Western States 100 and just a few months before the 2017 UTMB he won the Hardrock 100 in the United States, despite falling and dislocating his shoulder with 87 miles still to go. Being Superman, he popped it back into place, tied it up in a sling, and carried on to win the race.

- His press agent told me he hated crowds and spent no more than a few days a year in cities. He used to live in Chamonix in France, the town that hosts the UTMB, but, he said, ‘it was too big, too many people’. The town’s population is around 10,000. He has since moved with his girlfriend, Swedish ultra runner Emelie Forsberg, to an isolated region of Norway.

- ‘The record was not important,’ he said, puzzling over the menu. ‘What I really wanted to see in Everest, to test, is whether it was possible to move light in the Himalayas like we do in the Alps and other places, alone without ropes. Just grab what you need and go, not this big expedition with all this stuff. And it was.’ When I ask him about his preparation for Everest, how much training he had done, he said: ‘My preparation began when I was a child.’ ‘I did my first hike when I was eighteen months old,’ he said. ‘We hiked for seven hours.’ He was scaling summits aged three. This wasn’t the case of overbearing parents frogmarching him around the mountains. He said he loved it. And it is a love that has grown and stayed with him his whole life.

- In total he (Kilian) said he spends about 1,200 hours a year out training in the mountains (an average of over three hours a day), and climbs in total around 600,000m of ascent, an average of 1,640m every day. For reference, Ben Nevis, the highest peak in the British Isles, sits at 1,345m. He admitted, however, that it was not only the intense training that made him so good at mountain running. ‘I have good running genes,’ he said. ‘No matter how hard I dreamed, I could never play in the NBA. But I once had a VO2 max test [a measure of a person’s oxygen-carrying capacity, a big factor in how fast and far you can run] and it was quite high.’ This was an understatement. Jornet’s VO2 max test results stunned the researchers carrying them out. At 90 ml/ kg/ min it was one of the highest ever recorded. His resting heart rate, another measure of fitness, is absurdly low at 34. On top of this, Jornet said he can recover very quickly from exercise, which allows him to train hard day after day.

- In 2012, while preparing for a speed attempt on Mont Blanc, during the first stage of his Summits of My Life project, Jornet was with his good friend and three-time world champion ski-mountaineer Stéphane Brosse, when a snow cornice collapsed under them and Brosse fell to his death. The incident hit Jornet hard and made him question why he was doing all this. ‘He [Brosse] was my hero, then my friend. We were twenty centimetres apart when he fell, and I thought, why him, why not me? He had children, it would be better if it was me.’

- A year later, Jornet and his girlfriend, Emelie Forsberg, who is also a world champion skyrunner, had to be rescued when the weather turned bad out in the mountains near Chamonix. The rescue chief at the time was less than impressed, telling the media: ‘I’m very angry when I see the continued rise of running shoes [in the mountains] despite our requests.’

- Then, shortly before the Everest attempt, the renowned speed climber Ueli Steck died in an accident in the Himalayas. This too affected Jornet. ‘I had also been on Everest in 2016,’ he said. ‘That year I took more risks, I did things I wouldn’t do now. When you assess risk on the mountain, it depends on different things, on how you feel in yourself, in your capabilities, but also in the point you are at in your life. At this point, after Ueli’s death, I am more cautious.’

- But all this won’t stop Jornet continuing to seek to push himself and break barriers. ‘This is a risky thing,’ he said. ‘But life is risky. Life is not sitting on a sofa being safe. If you tell someone: “I love you”, that is a risk. On the mountain, I try to find the small space between being safe—because it is good to stay alive—and risk, the place where you can find your limits and challenge yourself.’

- And so, while I was shivering and feeling sorry for myself in a village hall in Anglesey, one of the greatest trail races in history played out in the Alps. In the early stages, Jornet, Walmsley, and 6ft 4in D’Haene ran together at the front. They were flying along, way under the course record, when Walmsley was heard saying: ‘It’s too slow.’ Jornet, the three-time winner, replied, according to the people watching: ‘No, it is too fast.’

- It blows cold through my jacket and sweaty T-shirt. I remember reading a blog by the US runner Dylan Bowman, about his race at the UTMB, where he said his only mistake was not putting enough clothes on the moment he felt the cold. Once your body temperature drops on the mountain, it’s hard to get it back up. So I stop and pull on an extra layer, and hike on.

- Watch any conventional long-distance race—a major road marathon, an international cross-country, or the Olympic 10,000m on the track, for example—and, with the odd exception, all the runners at the front will be from East Africa. In the marathon, Kenyans and Ethiopians dominate to an extent almost unparalleled in any sport—in 2017, for example, ninety-two of the top hundred men’s marathon runners were from East Africa, while for the women seventy-six of the top hundred marathoners were from the region. Yet in ultra running, there are virtually no top East African runners.

- When I start asking the athletes in Iten, the town at the epicentre of Kenyan running, if they would be interested in taking part in an ultra marathon, however, they seem confused by the whole concept. Running for 50 miles? They look at me like I might be trying to trick them. Is that possible? One runner, Duncan Kibet, who has a best marathon time of 2hrs 4mins, initially shows some interest. I’m looking for someone to run a 50-mile race, to start with. ‘How many days does it take?’ he asks. A marathon is 26 miles. This is less than twice that distance. ‘It won’t take you days,’ I tell him. But it illustrates how far out of their normal sphere of operation it is.

- In Kenya, promising marathon runners are signed up by agents, usually Europeans, who send them to races abroad and take a cut of their winnings. But with the lack of prize money, there are no agents looking for ultra runners. Part of the reason there are so many good Kenyan runners is because it is a way to change their lives, to escape poverty, and to help their families and communities. Even a relatively small cash prize at a second-tier city marathon in Europe goes a long way in Kenya and can change an athlete’s life. So money is a key motivator. They don’t have the luxury of running just for the love of it.

- I remember seeing an interview with the former marathon world record holder Wilson Kipsang in which they asked him at which point in a marathon it starts to hurt. He smiled and said: ‘The last kilometre.’ He may have been joking, or making light of the question, but it made me wonder if the Kenyans are used to operating in a relative comfort zone. Of course, they get tired, they fatigue, but they run so smoothly, in that way people always describe as ‘effortless’, that perhaps it isn’t the same struggle as it is for the rest of us.

- Joe Kelly once said he didn’t think ‘endurance running’ was a good label. He said it implied suffering, and then coping with it, enduring it. A better term would be ‘efficiency running’, he said. Because to run long distances well, you needed to be efficient with your energy, your body, not fight and struggle with it. That’s what the Kenyans do so well. But in an ultra, with the increased distance, the uneven terrain, the greater number of variables, it’s harder to achieve.

- The US runner Timothy Olson, in an interview after finishing fourth one year in the UTMB, said with relish: ‘I like going to those dark spots and overcoming it. In ultras, you think you’ve hit your lowest low in the last race, but ultras just keep surprising me how dark it can really get.’

- In an essay in The Philosophers’ Magazine in the United States, Professor Pam R Sailors quotes a paper by the celebrated psychologist Dr Arnold Cooper, entitled ‘The Psychology of Running’, in which he says one of the reasons people are motivated to take up long-distance running is that they have ‘narcissistic and masochistic needs’, which are ‘beautifully gratified by running distances which are clearly beyond the intended uses of the human body’.

- In 2012, cardiologist/ runners Carl Lavie and James O’Keefe caused a stir when they released a research paper that found that while moderate running was clearly healthy, those health benefits began to tail off and possibly reverse if you ran ‘excessively’. Initially they defined that as more than two and a half hours a week—though Lavie later revised it after further research to more than five hours a week. Ultra runners, of course, undertake much more than that, often in a single day. Lavie and O’Keefe’s main concern was heart damage and a hardening of the tissue around the heart brought on by extreme exercise. In a TED talk on the subject, O’Keefe said that while exercise is one of the best medicines for good all-round health, ‘like any drug, there’s an ideal dose range. If you don’t take enough, you don’t get the benefits. If you take too much, it could be harmful. Maybe even fatal.’

- A 2013 study from the University of Ballarat in Australia found that ultra runners have a life expectancy of up to sixteen years longer than the average person. The research, led by Dr Fadi Charchar, was based on the impact of distance running on telomeres in the human body. ‘Within our cells, telomeres are structures that work similar to the plastic parts or aglets of our shoelaces—that is, they protect our genes from fraying,’ Dr Charchar explains. Telomeres get shorter with age, and the shorter they are the more prone we are to disease. ‘The trick,’ he says, ‘is that we can actually do things to make our telomeres last longer. And we found that doing running—and lots of running—can do wonders for telomeres.’ The researchers found that ultra runners covering 40km to 100km a week had 11 per cent longer telomeres, which they said equates to sixteen more years’ life expectancy.

- In 2014, Dr Martin Hoffman, professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at the University of California, ran a study on a range of self-reported health issues in over 1,200 ultra runners. He concluded that they were healthier than the non-ultra running population, with a low prevalence of virtually all serious medical issues, and that they missed fewer days off work each year due to illness. I asked him about those studies that had linked ultra running to heart attacks, but he said he wasn’t convinced. ‘At present,’ he said, ‘there is no good evidence to prove there are negative long-term health consequences from ultra running.’

- The good thing about dealing with Kenyan runners is that they generally assume they can win virtually any race. They seem to possess a wonderful confidence, completely free of arrogance. Of course it’s often unrealistic, but they don’t beat themselves up if they fall short. They just get up and try again. It’s why a race in Kenya is an insane stampede right from the start, because everyone is racing to win and so is trying to run at the front.

- 2018, for the first time, the UTMB gave out prize money to the first ten finishers. The prize for first place was € 2,000.

- It’s amazing how many ultra runners I meet that are vegan. Tom and Rachel are vegan. The most famous vegan ultra runner is Scott Jurek, a ten-time winner of the Western States 100. There are many others. If you start typing ‘why are ultra runners . . .’ into Google, it autofills the next word as ‘vegan’.

- Elisabet’s new boyfriend, the Norwegian ultra runner Sondre Amdahl, is also vegan. ‘He was an influence,’ she says. ‘He opened my eyes a bit.’ Although she won’t be running the UTMB, she will be there crewing for Sondre, who is one of the elite runners.

- The big rival diet to veganism in the ultra running world is the LCHF (low carbohydrate, high fat) diet. Following it usually involves eating a lot of meat. The basic theory is that your body’s fat reserves are an almost infinite source of energy, but they are hard to tap into. So you have to train yourself to burn fat by restricting your carbohydrate intake and eating a lot of fat.

- ‘People are always looking for a quick fix, but veganism has stood the test of time. Carbs are not the enemy. Even people who follow the Paleo diet will use carbs on race day, because that’s what we need. The brain needs glucose to survive.’ Top US ultra running coach Jason Koop is more scathing: ‘The whole LCHF thing is a load of garbage. As a professional coach, I’ve seen it come and go three times in my career. It’s nothing new and the reason it goes away is because there are better approaches.’ Yet for every Scott Jurek proving you can win big ultra races on a vegan diet, there’s an athlete out there showing you can win races eating mostly fat. Jeff Browning, for example, started eating an LCHF diet in 2015 at the age of forty-four and within a few months won the tough Hurt 100 ultra in Hawaii. And he’s just as convinced of the benefits of his diet, saying in a recent interview: ‘I’m lighter and faster than I’ve been in years. I feel ten years younger. I’m winning races and setting records as an elite ultra marathoner—at age forty-four.’

- I ask her about dealing with pain in a race. Is the pain cave something she looks forward to? ‘I hate pain like I hate bad weather,’ she says, laughing. ‘When I’m struggling in a race, I always think, at least I’m not stuck behind a desk in London.’

- ‘I’ve also learned that pain will come and go,’ she adds. ‘I know it will pass. Don’t fight it, let it live its life, don’t give it attention—it seeks attention. Pain is really needy, like a dog. Ignore it and it will behave.’

- Part of fell running is knowing the mountains well, and as such it favours locals. ‘Part of the fun,’ says Abdelnoor, who lives in Ambleside in the heart of the Lake District, ‘is going out to recce the route beforehand, and finding some good lines. Not just turning up on the day with a GPX file and following your watch.’

- A controversy is bubbling in the fell running world after a number of races recently banned the use of GPS devices to help with navigation. Abdelnoor says the ban is needed to protect the uniqueness of fell running.

- Gruenke says that in Feldenkrais you don’t fix form simply by telling people to change how they move, because movement happens at a subconscious level. Over our lifetime, she says, we’ve all developed habits to achieve the movements we need in the best way we can, and—most importantly—without getting hurt. If we suddenly try to change these, even if the changes would be more efficient, our nervous system, which is always trying to protect us, will set off warning lights, causing us to tense up and reject the changes. For example, if she had just told me to run lighter on my feet, this could have caused all sorts of issues, because I wouldn’t really know what to change to make it happen, or whether these changes were going to cause me any pain or discomfort. What the Feldenkrais lesson did was allow my body to explore the new, more efficient movements in a way that felt safe and comfortable, so my nervous system knew they were not dangerous and could be adopted.

- Another thing she tells me as I run up and down after the session, is to hold my arms in a slightly different position, with my hands higher up. I try it and it feels great. I feel like Eliud Kipchoge. And in the weeks and months after the lesson, I hold my arms in this way on every single run and it continues to feel easy and natural.

- Hillary is just happy to be able to run at all. About three months after I spoke to her in Boulder, she went to run the Tromsø Sky Race in Norway. She was leading the Sky Race World Series, and a decent result in Tromsø would see her claim the overall world title. The course there is considered extremely technical, and as she neared the summit on an exposed ridge she stepped on a rock and the ground fell away beneath her. ‘I felt my bones breaking and then I felt like someone was kicking me in the chest,’ she says. She broke both wrists, three ribs, bones in her back and in her foot, badly twisted both ankles, and needed a lot of stitches including some in her head. It was months before she could even walk again unaided, yet ten months after her accident she was lining up at a big 53km Sky Race in California. That was a week ago. Now she’s here in Italy for another 50km race.

- While she was injured and couldn’t run, Hillary wrote a blog titled ‘Who Am I Without Running?’, which was shared widely on social media and stopped a lot of ultra runners in their tracks. ‘Since I’m not running, I feel as though I have lost my identity,’ she wrote. ‘I’m . . . trying desperately to prove that this emptiness I feel would be fixed if I could just run again. ‘The biggest impact of this rebuilding process has been that I no longer look at myself through the lens of singularity. I can see a more complete and complex person beneath the brightly coloured running shorts and shoes.’ For many people in this sport, running around in the mountains has become so central to who they are that they can’t imagine life without it. Dave Mackay, the injured runner I met in Colorado, was so determined to get back out there that he asked doctors to amputate his leg.* The call of the wild is strong, but Hillary sounded a note of caution: that life is bigger than this one activity.

- It’s funny that the rise in this sport is at least partly driven by ego, by a desire to impress, because so few sports can destroy the ego so ruthlessly.

- Once you descend into that dark place out on the trail, where everything is crashing down around you, you need to find something real to keep you moving. It could be love or pain, but it has to be real. It certainly won’t be Facebook likes.

- It seems that no matter how good you are, these races are never going to be easy. But it is the epic, challenging nature of them, the way they force you to dig so deep, that makes them special.

- In 2005, ultra runners Peter Bakwin and Buzz Burrell started the Fastest Known Time website, bringing the term into wider use. In the United States, a scene grew up around it, with people tackling and setting records each year on some of the most iconic trails in America, such as the 223-mile John Muir Trail through California’s Sierra Nevada, and the epic 2,175-mile Appalachian Trail.

- Runners taking on an FKT are expected to document their trips to prove they’ve broken the record, or have set a new one if there is no existing record on their route, but the unofficial, relaxed nature of the exercise is implicit in the name: Fastest Known Time. Someone may have done it faster, who knows?

- The Bob Graham Round in England’s Lake District, for example, was one of the most famous FKTs long before the term FKT was ever coined. In 1932, hotelier Bob Graham ran up and down forty-two peaks, covering a distance of 66 miles, in under 24 hours, setting a challenge now considered the holy grail of British fell running. In 1982, the legendary Billy Bland ran the same route, setting an almost impossible FKT of 13hrs 53mins.

- In a piece of running history, on his first attempt, the Catalan superstar smashes the old record by more than an hour, arriving at the finish at Moot Hall in Keswick in 12hrs 52mins to be greeted by a huge crowd and Billy Bland himself. After touching the door to mark the finish, Jornet sits chatting with Bland on the steps of of the hall, and together they open a bottle of champagne and share a celebratory swig or two. And, just like that, another chapter in the incredible story of Kilian Jornet has been written. It seems the normal rules of what is possible don’t apply to him.

- By racing up these huge mountains, Egloff and Jornet are crossing into the world of mountaineering, where FKTs are nothing new, but where they are simply called speed records. By repackaging it, however, Jornet and his team have grabbed the media’s attention the world over. Our drink in London was arranged for a Financial Times interview about his record attempt on Everest. They wanted a full-page feature on him.

- All Jornet’s case proves beyond doubt, is that as the stakes continue to get higher in this game, anyone planning to do something remarkable should plan on gathering some solid evidence. In the realm of FKTs, it seems the old-fashioned reliance on trust and goodwill alone is no longer enough.

- Walmsley is known for his fighting talk, which hasn’t always gone down well, but he now has the records to back it up. ‘When I first started out,’ he says, ‘people were like, “Man, you’re full of it.” But now that people know me, it doesn’t seem so crazy. But I was never trying to stir things up, I was just trying to be honest and candid, not give BS answers.’

- Only a few months before the UTMB, he finally did what he had been threatening to do for two years: break the course record at the Western States 100—and he did it on one of the hottest days in the race’s history. All that despite coming across a bear on the trail late in the race. It was at exactly the same point where he missed the turning in 2016. In 2017, he didn’t make it that far due to stomach issues, so when he turned the corner the right way in 2018 and saw the bear, he says his immediate response was: ‘You have got to be kidding me!’

- My first stop is a coffee with a real rising star in the sport, the British runner Tom Evans. A soldier in the British army, a few years ago he was sitting in a pub in London listening to two friends regale him with their stories of the Marathon des Sables and how well they had done. A little naively perhaps, he said: ‘Yes, it’s not bad, but there were still 290 people in front of you.’ Affronted, they told him that if he thought he could do better, he should run it the next year. So he did.

- ‘Sub 30,’ Damian Hall suggested when I told him I wasn’t sure about my goal time. ‘You should do that,’ he says, as though it’s easy. The number becomes fixed in my head, and I begin to think of it as the UTMB equivalent of the sub three-hour marathon.

- It was interesting before the race to ask these two Americans about their great rival and nemesis Kilian Jornet. In contrast to Walmsley, who is known for his competitiveness, always focused on winning and winning big, Jornet is famously laid back. If he doesn’t win—like the year before when he was second—he never seems to mind, and is apparently just as happy celebrating his rival’s victory. In the press conference before this year’s race, he played down the fact that he was going for a record fourth win at the UTMB, saying he just liked to run different types of races. This was just another day out in the mountains for him. Walmsley doesn’t completely buy it. ‘I think he’s more layered than he gives off,’ he told me. ‘It takes a super-competitive guy to want to keep coming back to do these races, to keep winning them.’

- Zach has even developed a theory to explain Jornet’s prowess. ‘Fitness and strength is like climbing a ladder,’ he says. ‘The more you do, the more your body can handle, the quicker you can recover, the more you can do . . . and it goes on. But the ladder has rules. You can’t miss a rung. Well, only by doping, but we’re not doing that. So as I run more in the mountains, I’m getting stronger, and I’m recovering quicker. But Kilian has been on the ladder for years, since he was sixteen.’

- I can’t help thinking that perhaps I’m overdoing it, but when I try to control my pace a little and put the brakes on, it feels much harder on my legs. Those braking muscles are tired from the early part of the race, so I find it better to let go and move more quickly. People talk of trashing your quads in a race like this. ‘If you do it right,’ Joe Kelly tells me, ‘your quads shouldn’t come in to it. They only get trashed if you’re braking.’ So I roll, skip, and run the descents, rather than brake. As the fell runners in the Lake District say, ‘Brakes off, brain off.’ They’re right, it’s faster and easier.

- Drama is unfolding at the front of the men’s race, meanwhile. Kilian Jornet has dropped out. The story that comes out is that he got stung by a bee a few hours before the race and had an allergic reaction. Wary of using anything that may include a banned substance, his team doctor uses a medicine he has never taken before. After the race he says he felt fine until after Courmayeur, but when he was heading up the hill after the aid station he began to get a heavy allergic reaction, saying it was difficult to breathe, and that he felt chest pains and nausea. In the end he said he felt it was dangerous to carry on and he decided to pull out.

- I think of something Lazarus Lake says in the film about the Barkley Marathons, after most of the runners have dropped out. ‘Everyone,’ he says, ‘after a certain point, has his own definition of success or failure.’

- Right after I finished the UTMB—or rather somewhere on the path between La Fouly and Champex Lac—I would have rather cut off my hand than agree to run another ultra marathon. But perhaps in the same way women forget the pain of childbirth, the pain of a race soon dissipates. Even up each hill it happens. Every long climb seems to go on for ever, getting tougher and tougher until I’m thinking this is insane, stupid—and still it goes on. But as soon as you’re over the top and moving down the other side, if you look back, you think: ‘It wasn’t that bad, actually.’

- It reminds me of the marathon monks of Mount Hiei in Japan who run a thousand marathons in a thousand days. ‘The idea behind the constant movement,’ one of the monks explained to me, ‘is to exhaust the mind, the ego, the body, everything, until nothing is left. Then something, pop,’ (and he mimes a bubble popping) ‘something comes up to fill the space.’ This something, he says, ‘is the vast consciousness that lies below the surface of our lives, beyond the limits of our usual, everyday experience. A sense of oneness,’ he says, ‘with the universe.’

- Most of the time we exist in a constructed world where everything is designed to keep us comfortable, keep us away from the rawness of life. But we evolved to exist in an environment that would often be tough, difficult, dangerous, and deep down I think we long for a connection to that ancestral existence.
