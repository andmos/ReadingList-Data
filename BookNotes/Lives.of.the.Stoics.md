### Highlights

- “You must,” Zeno would have heard the character Virtue say, “accustom your body to be the servant of your mind, and train it with toil and sweat.” ([Location 213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=213))
- He inched his way there, through years of study and training, as we all must. “Well-being is realized by small steps,” he would say, looking back, “but is truly no small thing.” ([Location 301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=301))
- In John Steinbeck’s East of Eden, Lee, a brilliant mind, well versed in Stoic philosophy, is asked why he demeans himself with the lowly profession of being a servant. He retorts that being a servant is actually the perfect profession for a philosopher: It’s quiet. It’s easy. It lets him study people. It gives him time to think. It is an opportunity, like any other job, for excellence and mastery. ([Location 340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=340))
- Anything you do well is noble, no matter how humble. And possibly even more admirable if you deliberately forgo status in the pursuit of what you really love. ([Location 343](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=343))
- It is clear that Cleanthes abhorred debt and luxury, preferring the freedom of a humble life to the slavery of extravagance. ([Location 389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=389))
- To Zeno, it was not controversial to say that one could lean toward virtue and still desire wealth or fame or preeminence, for those were tools to employ in the building of an even more virtuous life. In this way, the early Stoics argued that we can and should pursue preferred indifferents as part of the good, virtuous life. It’s a classic middle ground, practical realism to be expected from someone like Zeno who was a merchant before he was a philosopher, as well as precisely the kind of thing that his student Aristo could not stand. ([Location 528](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=528))
- “Runners in a race ought to compete and strive to win as hard as they can,” Chrysippus would later say, “but by no means should they trip their competitors or give them a shove. So too in life; it is not wrong to seek after the things useful in life; but to do so while depriving someone else is not just.” ([Location 646](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=646))
- Seneca would later speak of the importance of reading and studying other philosophies like a spy in the enemy camp. Indeed, we find that the early years of Chrysippus’s career were spent not at the elbow of the living Stoic masters but at the side of Arcesilaus and Lacydes, both of whom headed Plato’s Academy. It’s not that he had conflicting loyalties; it’s that he knew that if Stoicism was to survive, it would have to learn from its more established rivals. ([Location 685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=685))
- He studied the arguments of rival schools, even taking classes in the Platonists’ school so that he could identify weak points in their arguments. He studied the weaknesses of his own arguments to see where Stoicism had to improve. ([Location 689](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=689))
- There is sometimes no better way to strengthen your defense than to learn your opponent’s offense, and this is precisely what a good philosopher does. Today we called this “steel-manning”—you don’t need to cheat by assuming the worst about the ideas you’re arguing against. Instead, you can engage with them seriously and earnestly, winning by merit, not by mischaracterization. And as a fighter, Chrysippus enjoyed the challenge. ([Location 690](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=690))
- It’s not that Chrysippus forsook all pleasures and all money; it’s that he was suspicious of wanting, lusting for anything. A wise man can make use of whatever comes his way, he said, but is in want of nothing. “On the other hand,” he said, “nothing is needed by the fool for he does not understand how to use anything but he is in want of everything.” There is no better definition of a Stoic: to have but not want, to enjoy without needing. ([Location 737](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=737))
- It’s a reminder all these years later for everyone considering their legacy. It’s not what you say that lives on after your time; it’s not what you write or even what you build. It’s the example that you set. It’s the things that you live by. ([Location 854](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=854))
- Stoics can love and be loved? Absolutely. Not only can they, but they should, as Antipater clearly did. ([Location 981](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=981))
- This is what the pursuit of virtue is in real life. We study. We train until things become second nature. The moment arrives. We commit. We hold up what’s right as our target. We take action. But much happens after that—much of it not remotely up to us. Which is why we know that our true worth doesn’t reside in whether or not we get a bull’s-eye. ([Location 1004](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=1004))
- Learn. Apply. Learn. Apply. Learn. Apply. This is the Stoic way. ([Location 1077](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=1077))
- Panaetius argues that if we are to live an ethical life and choose appropriate actions, we must find a way to balance: the roles and duties common to us all as human beings; the roles and duties unique to our individual daimon, or personal genius/calling; the roles and duties assigned to us by the chance of our social station (family and profession); the roles and duties that arise from decisions and commitments we have made. ([Location 1148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=1148))
- Everyone can have a life of meaning and purpose. Everyone can do what they do like a good Stoic. ([Location 1165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=1165))
- Humanity is given these instincts toward virtue by nature, and we can thrive and live nobly if we learn to live consistently with our own nature and our duties, while making the most of the resources we have been given. ([Location 1167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=1167))
- Panaetius, while born to privilege, chose not to settle into that comfortable life of ease. Instead, he openly embraced duty and the responsibility of a much broader stage. He took the resources he was given and leveraged them, becoming the best version of himself and contributing as much as he could to the big projects of his time. Each of us, he believed, is obligated to do the same. ([Location 1169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=1169))
- Cicero claimed, for instance, that Panaetius argued it was possible for a good lawyer to defend a guilty client—provided they were not egregiously depraved or wicked. Not only is it a position that makes sense given Panaetius’s deep belief in each individual’s duty and role in life, but it is also a practical innovation that has been a pillar of the legal system over the last two thousand years: If no one steps up to defend undesirable clients, how can we be sure that justice is being done? ([Location 1197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=1197))
- Suppose your son dies, he said. You must remind yourself that you knew he was mortal when you brought him into the world. The same is true for friends, he would have had to reassure himself. The same is true for careers. ([Location 1210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=1210))
- If you want the job done right, there’s no one better to do it than a Stoic. If you want someone to aid you in your crimes and corruption, there’s nobody worse. ([Location 1251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=1251))
- As he no doubt learned from his teacher, Panaetius, like the pankratist, you must be prepared at all times for the unexpected blows of life—if not to block them, at least to absorb and endure them without whining. ([Location 1294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=1294))
- When the state is beyond redemption and helplessly corrupt, the Stoics believed, the wise man will stay away. ([Location 1306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=1306))
- Doing the right thing could cost a person everything. ([Location 1312](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=1312))
- It was all an early lesson that in an unpredictable world, the only thing we can really manage is ourselves—and that the space between our ears is the only territory we can conquer in any kind of certain and enduring way. ([Location 1347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=1347))
- You can and should be interested in everything, the Stoics taught, because you can and should learn wisdom from everything. ([Location 1364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=1364))
- The more you experience, the more you learn, and, paradoxically, the more humbled you are by the endless amounts of knowledge that remain in front of you. ([Location 1365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=1365))
- “Best,” to the Stoics, did not meaning winning battles. Superior did not mean accumulating the most honors. It meant, as it still does today, virtue. It meant excellence not in accomplishing external things—though that was always nice if fate allowed—but excellence in the areas that you controlled: Your thoughts. Your actions. Your choices. ([Location 1425](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=1425))
- The Stoic is supposed to be beyond grudges, beyond revenge, beyond petty competition or the need to win arguments. Certainly, they’re not supposed to do anything—let alone lie and mislead—out of spite. ([Location 1496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=1496))
- “If you have a garden and a library,” Cicero would write in a letter to a friend as they discussed Chrysippus and Diodotus, “you have everything you need.” ([Location 1625](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=1625))
- In what was more a rhetorical exercise than a serious philosophical treatment, he explored six of the primary Stoic paradoxes: that virtue is the only good; that it is sufficient for happiness; that all virtues and vices are equal; that all fools are mad; that only the sage is truly free; that the wise person alone is rich. ([Location 1714](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=1714))
- But he had compromised much to get there. He had ignored the sterner parts of Stoicism—the parts about self-discipline and moderation (as his chubby visage demonstrates), the duties and the obligations. He had ignored his conscience, in defiance of the oracle, to seek out the cheers of the crowd. If he had followed Posidonius and Zeno better, his life might not have turned out differently, but he would have been steadier. He would have been stronger. ([Location 1789](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=1789))
- Once after visiting the house of Sulla, Cato asked his tutor why so many people were there paying homage and offering favors—was Sulla really this popular? Sarpedon explained that Sulla received these honors not because he was loved but because he was feared. “Why then didn’t you give me a sword,” he said, “so I could free my country from slavery?!” ([Location 1838](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=1838))
- Life is not fair and it cares little for our feelings or our plans. ([Location 1871](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=1871))
- In fact, despite his public positions and his wealthy family, Cato often looked like he had no money at all. He rejected the extravagant, brilliantly colored purple robes that were fashionable in the Senate and wore only a plain, ordinary dark robe. He never put on perfume. He walked Rome’s streets barefoot and wore nothing underneath his toga. While his friends rode horses, he declined, and enjoyed walking alongside them. ([Location 1892](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=1892))
- We naturally care what people think of us; we don’t want to seem too different, so we acquire the same tastes as everyone else. We accept what the crowd does so the crowd will accept us. But in doing this, we weaken ourselves. We compromise, often without knowing it; we allow ourselves to be bought—without even the benefit of getting paid for it. ([Location 1900](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=1900))
- His studies of Stoicism had taught him the importance of training, of actively resisting temptation and inoculating oneself from the need for comforts and externals. ([Location 1917](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=1917))
- he was ready to go down fighting, as we all must be—if we are true philosophers—at some point in our lives. ([Location 1996](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=1996))
- A Stoic does the job that needs to be done. They don’t care about credit. ([Location 2004](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=2004))
- She had lived as her father and the Stoics had taught: We must do what needs to be done. We must not waver. We cannot be afraid. ([Location 2158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=2158))
- Renting a large mansion in Athens that was purported to be haunted, Athenodorus, undaunted by the stories, set about putting his house in order. Almost immediately, he said, he was visited by a ghost clapped in irons and dragging heavy chains. Not to be disturbed from his writing session, Athenodorus motioned for the ghost to wait and returned to his work. When he finished, he got up and followed the apparition into the courtyard, where it suddenly vanished. Thinking fast, Athenodorus marked the spot where the ghost disappeared and then returned to tidy up his desk and go to bed. ([Location 2190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=2190))
- Whether one believed in ghosts or the supernatural, as Octavian likely did, was beside the point. Stoics must always keep their head. Even the scariest situations can be resolved with reason and courage. And even if you believe in silly things like ghosts or superstitions, you can’t let your life be ruled by them. You must be in charge—no excuses. ([Location 2197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=2197))
- Yes, we must carefully follow public affairs, but it was also necessary to leave behind the grind of work and the stress of politics with retreats into the private sphere of friends. Athenodorus would note that Socrates would stop and play games with children in order to rest and have fun. The mind must be replenished with leisure, Athenodorus believed, or it was likely to break under pressure, or be susceptible to vices. ([Location 2205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=2205))
- “Whenever you feel yourself getting angry, Caesar,” he instructed, “don’t say or do anything until you’ve repeated the twenty-four letters of the alphabet to yourself.” ([Location 2214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=2214))
- The Stoics would have never argued that life was fair or that losing someone didn’t hurt. But they believed that to despair, to tear ourselves apart in bereavement, was not only an affront to the memory of the person we loved, but a betrayal of the living who still needed us. ([Location 2275](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=2275))
- His definitions were straightforward, essentially defining virtue as types of knowledge. As he simply defines it: Wisdom is the knowledge of what things must be done and what must not be done and what is neither, or appropriate acts (kathekonta). Within wisdom, we’ll find virtuous qualities like soundness of judgment, circumspection, shrewdness, sensibleness, soundness of aim, and ingenuity. Self-control is the knowledge of what things are worth choosing and what are worth avoiding and what is neither. Contained within this virtue are things like orderliness, propriety, modesty, and self-mastery. Justice is the knowledge of apportioning each person and situation what is due. Under this banner Stoics placed piety (giving gods their due), kindness, good fellowship, and fair dealing. Bravery is the knowledge of what is terrible and what isn’t and what is neither. This included perseverance, intrepidness, greatheartedness, stoutheartedness, and, one of Arius’s most favored virtuous qualities—one he illustrated well in his own life—philoponia, or industriousness. ([Location 2288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=2288))
- Individuality and autonomy, these are things many people pay lip service to—in fact, it’s almost become a new form of conformity. We talk about being our unique selves, about letting our colors shine, but deep down we know this is just talk. Under pressure, when it really counts, we want the same things as everyone else. We do the same things as everyone else. ([Location 2357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=2357))
- He saw life for what it was, exile for what it was, the cruelty of emperors for what it was, accepted it, and moved on. ([Location 2395](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=2395))
- Life takes our plans and dashes them to pieces. As Seneca would later write, we should never underestimate fortune’s habit of behaving just as she pleases. Just because we have worked hard, just because we are showing promise and our path toward success is clear has no bearing on whether we will get what we want. ([Location 2457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=2457))
- “Let us prepare our minds as if we’d come to the very end of life,” he reminded himself. “Let us postpone nothing. Let us balance life’s books each day. . . . The one who puts the finishing touches on their life each day is never short of time.” ([Location 2497](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=2497))
- Seneca wrote, “to think we look forward toward death. Most of death is already gone. Whatever time has passed is owned by death.” That was what he realized, that we are dying every day and no day, once dead, can be revived. ([Location 2502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=2502))
- A Stoic must learn when to walk away when the cause is hopeless. Seneca realized this too late, well after he was complicit in enabling Nero. ([Location 2891](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=2891))
- You do your job, I’ll do mine, the Stoic says. You be evil, I’ll be good. Let everything else come what may. ([Location 3021](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=3021))
- But what of all the comforts he was deprived of? Musonius chose to think about what he still had access to—the sun, water, air. ([Location 3123](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=3123))
- When he was in Rome, even at the height of his powers, Musonius sought out cold, heat, thirst, hunger, and hard beds. He familiarized himself with the uncomfortable feelings these conditions brought about and taught himself to be patient, even happy, while experiencing them. By this training, he said, “the body is strengthened and becomes capable of enduring hardship, sturdy and ready for any task.” Exile did come, and he was ready body and soul. Good times returned as well, and for this he was ready too. ([Location 3138](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=3138))
- “If one accomplishes some good though with toil, the toil passes, but the good remains,” he said. “If one does something dishonorable with pleasure, the pleasure passes, but the dishonor remains.” ([Location 3169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=3169))
- “Philosophy is nothing else than to search out by reason what is right and proper and by deeds put it into practice.” Rufus had said this, but more important he had lived it. As an exile. As a teacher. As a husband and father, and finally as a dying man. ([Location 3209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=3209))
- The Stoics believed we decided how we would react to what happened to us. Epictetus, as we each hold the power to do, chose to see his disability as only a physical impairment, and in fact it was that idea of choice, we shall see, that defined the core of his philosophical beliefs. ([Location 3253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=3253))
- To Epictetus, no human was the full author of what happened in life. Instead, he said, it was as if we were in a play, and if it was the playwright’s “pleasure you should act a poor man, a cripple, a governor, or a private person, see that you act it naturally. For this is your business, to act well the character assigned you; to choose it is another’s.” ([Location 3255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=3255))
- He saw aspiring candidates for the office of consul working themselves to the bone to earn the position. He saw the gifts that were expected, the spectacles that had to be put on, the chain of offices that needed to be held for years in order to get ahead. That’s freedom? ([Location 3264](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=3264))
- “It is better to starve to death in a calm and confident state of mind,” he would say, “than to live anxiously amidst abundance.” ([Location 3274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=3274))
- “If a person gave away your body to some passerby, you’d be furious,” Epictetus said, yet we so easily hand our mind over to other people, letting them inside our heads or making us feel a certain way. ([Location 3297](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=3297))
- As he came to study and understand Stoicism, he adopted this lesson into what he described as our “chief task in life.” It was, he said, simply “to identify and separate matters so that I can say clearly to myself which are externals not under my control, and which have to do with the choices I actually control.” Or, in his language, what is up to us and what is not up to us (ta eph’hemin, ta ouk eph’hemin). ([Location 3315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=3315))
- Once we have organized our understanding of the world into this stark categorization, what remains—what was so central to Epictetus’s survival as a slave—is to focus on what is up to us. Our attitudes. Our emotions. Our wants. Our desires. Our opinions about what has happened to us. ([Location 3319](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=3319))
- Are we going to choose to see that our brother is a selfish jerk? Or are we going to remember that we share the same mother, that he’s not this way on purpose, that we love him, that we have our own bad impulses too?* This decision—which handle we grab, day in and day out, with anyone and everyone we deal with—determines what kind of life we have. And what kind of person we will be. ([Location 3325](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=3325))
- If a person wants to be happy, wants to feel fairly treated, wants to be rich, according to Epictetus, they don’t need life to be easy, people to be nice, and money to flow freely. They need to look at the world right. “It’s not things that upset us,” he would say, “it’s our judgment about things.” Our opinions determine the reality we experience. Epictetus didn’t believe it was possible to be offended or frustrated, not without anyone’s consent. “Remember, it is not enough to be hit or insulted to be harmed, you must believe that you are being harmed,” he said. ([Location 3338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=3338))
- “resolve to live as a grown-up who is making progress, and make whatever you think best a law that you never set aside. And whenever you encounter anything that is difficult or pleasurable, or highly or lowly regarded, remember that the contest is now: you are at the Olympic Games, you cannot wait any longer, and that your progress is wrecked or preserved by a single day and a single event.” ([Location 3365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=3365))
- You can only lose what you have. You don’t control your possessions, so don’t ascribe more value to them than they deserve. ([Location 3373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=3373))
- “It’s impossible to begin to learn that which one thinks they already know,” ([Location 3398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=3398))
- It’s an example that should challenge every talented and brilliant person: You owe it to yourself and to the world to actively engage with the brief moment you have on this planet. You cannot retreat exclusively into ideas. You must contribute. ([Location 3451](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=3451))
- The most confident leaders—the best ones—often are worried that they won’t do a good enough job. They go into the job knowing it will not be an easy one. But they do proceed. ([Location 3602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=3602))
- Marcus believed that plagues and war could only threaten our life. What we need to protect is our character—how we act within these wars and plagues and life’s other setbacks. And to abandon character? That’s real evil. ([Location 3621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=3621))
- “Whenever you have trouble getting up in the morning, remind yourself that you’ve been made by nature for the purpose of working with others.” ([Location 3726](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=3726))
- Alexander the Great and his mule driver, Marcus writes, both died and both ended up buried in the same cold ground. What good was fame or accomplishment? It didn’t hold a candle to character. ([Location 3733](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=3733))
- Instead of holding them to his standards or expecting the impossible—as many talented, brilliant leaders naturally do—he focused on their strengths and was tolerant of their weaknesses. Like Lincoln again, Marcus was not afraid of being disagreed with, and made use of common ground and common cause as best he could. “So long as a person did anything good,” Dio Cassius writes, Marcus “would praise him and use him for the service in which he excelled, but to his other conduct he paid no attention; ([Location 3767](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083HL8RLK&location=3767))
