### Highlights

- The People claiming to opt-out of power-games, showing powerlessness, no motive or selflessness are most often the most cunning in the game of power themselves. Being honest, selfless is in itself a power move.

- Showing naivet√© and and 'not knowing' can be an effective deceit. Those who acts most innocent are seldom that.

- There is great strength in mastering your emotions. Anger is often the most destructive.

- Stay alert, never let anything catch you buy surprise. Patience.

- Rule 1: Never outshine the master. The master has insecurities. He will fear the most smart or clever. By letting others outshine you, you remain in control. The stars never shows up with the sun.

- Rule 2: Never put too much trust in friends, learn how to use enemies. Hire a former enemy, he as more to prove. Friends often fall victim to envy. Show trust in enemies.

- 'Do I not destroy my enemy when I make him my friend?'

- Rule 3: Conceal your intentions. If they have no idea what you are up to, they cannot prepare a defense. Do the opposite of what people say or think you will do.

- Rule 4: Always say less than necessary. When trying to impress people with words, the more you say, the more common you appear, and the less in control. Even if you say something banal, it will seam original if you make it vague and open-ended. Intimidate by saying less. The more you say, te more likely to say something foolish. No one knows what you want to hear if you don't tell them. Speak less, people can't grasp you.

- Rule 5: So much depends on your reputation, guard it with your life. If you have a reputation for doing unpredictable things, people will fear or be aware of you. A solid reputation puts others under a spell.

- Rule 6: Court attention at all cost. Everything is judged by appearance, stand out and be seen. Be a magnet of attention. At the beginning of your rise to the top, spend energy on getting attention. Any attention.

- Rule 7: Get others to do the work for you, but always take the credit. Use the wisdom, knowledge and legwork of other people to further your own case, it gives you a god-like aura of efficiency and speed. Take Credit from those below and give to those above.

- Learn to use the knowledge of the past and you will look like a genius.

- Rule 8: Make other people come to you, use bait if necessary. When you force the other person to act, you are control. By making an enemy come to you, you make him think he is in control, that it is his choice. Napoleon's escape.

- Rule 9: Win through actions, never through argument. Show, don't tell; any momentary triumph you think you have won through argument is ephemeral; it is more powerful to demonstrate, without argument. When using actions over arguments, nobody is offended.

- Rule 10: Infection: Avoid the unhappy and unlucky. You can die from someone else's misery - emotional states are as infectious as diseases. The unfortunate sometimes draw misfortune on themselves, and on you. Associate with cheerful and positive people if you yourself are negative.

- Rule 11: Learn to keep people dependent on you. To maintain your independence you must always be needed and wanted. The more you are relied on, the more freedom you have. Make their happiness depend on you.

- If you are ambitious, it is much wiser to seek out weak rulers or masters to create a relationship of dependency. Go to the small dam, not the biggest one.

- Possess a skill or talent, or a combination of them, that cannot be replaced.

- Rule 12: Use selective honesty and generosity to disarm the victim. One sincere and honest move will cover over dozens of dishonest ones. Honesty can be as good a trojan horse as anything.

- Open-hearted gestures of honesty brings down the guard of even the most suspicious people.

- Give before you take.

- Rule 13: When asking for help, appeal to to self-interest, never to mercy or gratitude. Set up win-win situations, find out the other part's self-interest and bargain with it.

- Rule 14: Pose as a friend, work as a spy. Play the spy and get valuable information about your enemy. Learn to probe, ask indirect questions.

- Rule 15: Crush your enemy totally. Crush him, or he will seek revenge.

- Rule 16: Use absence to increase respect and honor. The more you are seen and heard from, the more common you appear. If established in a group, temporary withdrawal from it will make you talked about and even more admired. Learn when to leave. Create value through scarcity.

- Rule 17: Keep others in suspended terror: cultivate and air of unpredictability. Humans are creatures of habit with a need to see familiarity in other peoples action: your predictability gives a sense of control. Turn the tables, be deliberately unpredictable. Actions with no consistency or purpose will keep them off balance, trying to explain your moves among themselves. Be unpredictable, break up patterns.

- Rule 18: Do not build fortresses to protect yourself, isolation is dangerous. Isolation exposes you yo more danger than it protects you from it: it cuts you off from valuable information, it makes you suspicious and an easy target. Better to circulate with people and find allies. You are safe from enemies in a crowd. Don't isolate, be open, move around and make allies.

- Isolation is dangerous. For the creative, it results in a loss of proportion, an obsession with details combined with an ability to not see the bigger picture.

- Rule 19: Know who you are dealing with: Do not offend the wrong person. Choose your victims and opponents carefully, then never offend or deceive the wrong person.

- The 5 kinds of people you meet: The arrogant and proud man, touchy pride oversensitive and angry. The insecure man, fragile ego, sense of self is insecure and defensive. Likely to nibble you to death. The suspicious man, your Stalin, paranoid, sees only the worst intentions, thinks everyone are out to get him. He is the least dangerous. The serpent with the long memory, shows no anger when hurt or deceived, but boils over time. The unassuming and unintelligent man, he will not take the bait because he does not recognize it.

- To see what kind of person you are dealing with, make a joke at their expense. If they laugh, they are confident. An insecure person will take offense - be careful with these people, they will do anything to restore pride.

- Desire is like a virus: If we see that someone or something is desired by other people, we will desire it too.
