### Highlights

- The best bridge between despair and hope is a good night’s sleep.

- Inadequate sleep disrupts blood sugar levels so profoundly that you would be classified as pre-diabetic.

- Sleep is the single most effective thing we can do to reset our brain and body health each day

- The shorter your sleep, the shorter your life. The leading causes of disease and death in developed nations all have recognized causal links to a lack of sleep.

- Practice does not make perfect. It is practice, followed by a night of sleep, that leads to perfection.

- Routinely sleeping less than six or seven hours a night demolishes your immune system.

- When sleep is abundant, minds flourish. When it is deficient, they don't.

- Humans are not sleeping the way nature intended. The number of sleep bouts, the duration of sleep, and when sleep occurs has all been comprehensively distorted by modernity.

- If you don’t sleep the very first night after learning, you lose the chance to consolidate those memories, even if you get lots of “catch-up” sleep thereafter. In terms of memory, then, sleep is not like the bank. You cannot accumulate a debt and hope to pay it off at a later point in time. Sleep for memory consolidation is an all-or-nothing event.

- Routinely sleeping less than six or seven hours a night demolishes your immune system, more than doubling your risk of cancer.

- Caffeine has an average half-life of five to seven hours. Let’s say that you have a cup of coffee after your evening dinner, around 7:30 p.m. This means that by 1:30 a.m., 50 percent of that caffeine may still be active and circulating throughout your brain tissue. In other words, by 1:30 a.m., you’re only halfway to completing the job of cleansing your brain of the caffeine you drank after dinner.

- The second evolutionary contribution that the REM-sleep dreaming state fuels is creativity. NREM sleep helps transfer and make safe newly learned information into long-term storage sites of the brain. But it is REM sleep that takes these freshly minted memories and begins colliding them with the entire back catalog of your life’s autobiography. These mnemonic collisions during REM sleep spark new creative insights as novel links are forged between unrelated pieces of information. Sleep cycle by sleep cycle, REM sleep helps construct vast associative networks of information within the brain. REM sleep can even take a step back, so to speak, and divine overarching insights and gist: something akin to general knowledge—that is, what a collection of information means as a whole, not just an inert back catalogue of facts. We can awake the next morning with new solutions to previously intractable problems.
