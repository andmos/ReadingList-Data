### Highlights

- Accordingly, one can view artificial intelligence as a quest to find shortcuts: ways of tractably approximating the Bayesian ideal by sacrificing some optimality or generality while preserving enough to get high performance in the actual domains of interest.

- One sympathizes with John McCarthy, who lamented: "As soon, as it works, no one calls it Al anymore." (John McCarthy, "The Art of Computer Programming", Vol. 1, Addison-Wesley, 1970)

- The computer scientist Donald Knuth was struck that “AI has by now succeeded in doing essentially everything that requires ‘thinking’ but has failed to do most of what people and animals do ‘without thinking’—that, somehow, is much harder!" (Donald Knuth, "The Art of Computer Programming", Vol. 1, Addison-Wesley, 1970)

- there is one more thing that we should emphasize, which is that an artificial intelligence need not much resemble a human mind. Als could be--indeed, it is likely that most will be--extremely alien. We should expect that they will have very different cognitive architec- tures than biological intelligences, and in their early stages of development they will have very different profiles of cognitive strengths and weaknesses (though, as we shall later argue, they could eventually overcome any initial weakness). Furthermore, the goal systems of Als could diverge radically from those of human beings. There is no reason to expect a generic Al to be motivated by love or hate or pride or other such common human senti- ments: these complex adaptations would require deliberate expensive effort to recreate in Als. This is at once a big problem and a big opportunity. We will return to the issue of AI motivation in later chapters, but it is so central to the argument in this book that it is worth bearing in mind throughout.

- A third path to greater-than-current-human intelligence is to enhance the functioning of biological brains. In principle, this could be achieved without technology, through selective breeding. Any attempt to initiate a classical large-scale eugenics program, however, would confront major political and moral hurdles.

- Far from being the smartest possible biological species, we are probably better thought of as the stupidest possible biological species capable of starting a technological civilization - a niche we filled because we got there first, not because we are in any sense optimally adapted to it.

- The image of evolution as a process that reliably produces benign effects is difficult to reconcile with the enormous suffering that we see in both the human and the natural world. Those who cherish evolution’s achievements may do so more from an aesthetic than an ethical perspective. Yet the pertinent question is not what kind of future it would be fascinating to read about in a science fiction novel or to see depicted in a nature documentary, but what kind of future it would be good to live in: two very different matters.
