### Highlights

- He'd imagined Lightweavers as strange beings who turned the truth into whatever they wanted it to be. But perhaps re-forming the truth into what you wanted it to be was not a trait merely of liars, but fall human beings.

- ...Goobering? "You know," Leyten said. "Poking around, working on projects here and there. Doing inventory, running accounts, cleaning shelves. Just... living, without stressing about what you might or might not get done. Goobering."

- Do you know why there are so few true swordmasters, Szeth? the Voice asked. It's because the consequences of mistakes are so high, the Voice said, conver-sationally.

- "This' therapy' is too easy," the spren said. "All you do is sit and listen, then tell me things I already kind of know." "Remarkable," Kaladin said, "how little we do things like that though, isn't it?" The spren didn't have a face, only a void of stars, but he seemed to be smiling as he replied. "It is remarkable.
