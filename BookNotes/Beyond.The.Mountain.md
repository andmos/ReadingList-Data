### Highlights

- I admire Steve House for his approach to the mountains. Step by step he has become the best alpinist he can become. In my view he is at the top of mountaineering. He climbs the right routes on the right mountains in a time when everyone is climbing Everest. Often we haven’t even heard of the peak he is climbing on.

- The times he succeeds he learns that success is as temporary as the snow in spring.

- “The simpler we make things, the richer the experiences become.” But only if we remain active, only if we try, only if we risk–and especially when we fail. Failure is a part of learning. Through our failures we learn the most.

- My most rewarding days were days when I cut away everything; when I redefined my understanding of necessity.

- Remember: the simpler you make things, the richer the experience becomes.

- We’ve climbed into the “death zone,” the altitude at which nothing can live for long without supplemental aids, like bottled oxygen, something Bruce and I would never consider. For us sucking O is doping, cheating. Besides, carrying the heavy bottles of oxygen is physically impossible in our chosen style–alpine style–of climbing. The style is so named because it utilizes the same methods used to climb smaller peaks in the Alps. You climb with a backpack containing your food, fuel, shelter, clothing and climbing gear. And, if all goes well, you bring it all back down.

- Nanga Parbat is the ninth highest peak in the world. In Urdu the name means the Naked Mountain. Its Rupal Face, the largest mountain wall in the world, is so steep that winter snows do not cling to the smooth, black gneiss that glaciers slowly mill into the powdery sand piled in front of the hotel.

- I know I can climb Nanga Parbat, but others know us by what we’ve done, not what we can do.

- Before the morning’s sun turns hot, I am out doing aerobic recovery tests. I step up on a knee-high rock repeatedly for five minutes, then measure how long it takes my heart rate to return to normal. It doesn’t ever get below 90. Even in the mess tent an hour later, the monitor still reads 96. Before the attempt my resting heart rate at the 12,000-foot base camp was 48.

- Climbing the Rupal Face would have been the greatest accomplishment of my life. I had to go down with Bruce because his no was necessarily stronger than my yes. That his no might have saved my life does not sit well with my ego.

- “Hi, I’m Ljubo. Welcome to Mountaineering Club Kozjak. You climbing before?” I nod and he continues. “You sit and see how we make things here. Afterwards we go on one beer and we make plan for climbing. No? You have bus pass to go home? No?” Three days later Ljubo and I are climbing on a small slab of rock in the forest of Pohorje, Maribor’s patron mountain. I had toproped many rock climbs and led easy multipitch climbs at Smith Rock in Oregon. But Ljubo’s lessons are strict. More directed. Definitely more purposeful than the school-of-hard-knocks lessons a teenager with a climbing rope and a rack of hexes learns on his own. After allowing me to scamper up, eager to show off my skill, he lowers me back down. “Štef, again. Now slowly and be sure.” I have found a new school: one whose language I readily understand. The school of Slovenian alpinism.

- I pick up my journal, shifting uncomfortably on the rock. As far I as I can see there are unclimbed mountains of striking danger and uncommon beauty. “What I have learned about myself on this expedition I will be assimilating for a long time,” I write. “There were many valuable lessons. I have been shown how much I did not know. Marija and Jože have also shown me how much can be done. Becoming an alpinist, an alpinist who can reach these summits, including Nanga Parbat. That is what I want to become.” I pause, focusing on the tiny points of the summits piercing the horizon. I put the pen back to the paper. “Rereading what I just wrote, I realize that I’m not even sure exactly what that entails. I suppose I need to get more experience. I know that I need to improve my own climbing. And organize my own climbs. I need to get good enough not to need fixed ropes. What a disaster fixed ropes and camps are! I have to find a way to surround myself with good climbers. Good partners will make me a better climber. And that’s what I want to be, the best climber I can become. If I could climb the Rupal Face some day, that would be the ultimate. I can’t imagine ever becoming good enough for that.”

- I sit quietly in the back, an exhausted youth struggling between testosterone-surges of arrogance and powerful doses of mountain-induced humility.

- The climbing stories I read as a youth had been full of avalanches, rock fall, crevasses, storms, exhaustion, and extreme altitude. Men–for they were mostly men–succeeding, but also failing and dying. It’s not just a story anymore.

- I can’t ask for their forgiveness when I can’t make them understand my sins.

- Light and fast means cold and hungry.

- Fears are overcome incrementally. Increasing skill, ambition and experience has eroded my fear of exposure and isolation. Experience has dispelled my existential fear of this universe of rock and ice and snow.

- Thinking about the climbers who preceded us renews my confidence. I can see that without heavy packs we can go much farther than I ever imagined. By embracing one kind of risk–not being equipped to stop for more than a few hours, no matter what the situation–we are stretching the safety net of speed to another level. The less time we’re on the wall the less chance we have of being caught in a storm. With our crampons and ice tools we’re climbing this idea into action.

- My college classmates write from their graduate school jobs with tales of endless titrations completed in science labs, of 80-hour weeks researching their professor’s theses. I slowly kick steps up 20,000-foot volcanoes and resent my lack of intellectual challenge. Knowing my goals are solely mine, I scoff at those who went to grad school, or took so-called real jobs. That is the ultimate sellout: to work for the man. To cast your only soul into a hell of cubicles and workstations and dollar bills. And if they don’t see this, they don’t deserve the chance to find out who they might become.

- I am a punk in crampons. Living to climb. Climbing to live. A lucky rabbit, saved not by my own brilliance, but by the odd-chance that in Slovenia I had been shown the Wonderland trap door of climbing. I am sure that alpinism can reveal everything I need to know as a human being.

- I have exorcised my own expectations and embraced life in the moment. The socialistic Slovenes showed me the way with their actions, their spirits, and their thoughts. They lived in a country with no future. Redemption, they taught, can be achieved only by showing great spirit, style, and fortitude. That is how I see it. Time may soften my piety.

- I have read all the books and know that none of the legendary climbers had done their first great climbs later than the age of 26. At 24, Reinhold Messner soloed the north face of Les Droites in eight hours, thereby revolutionizing ice climbing. Deep down I know that I have something great in me, something that will suit my strengths. Something alpine, icy, and committing. To achieve it, I will need to commit everything to my art.

- As I move towards the icy corner I remind myself of the stakes: my life. Part of the beauty of soloing is that the risks are so high and so obvious. I whisper my promises. “Don’t climb up anything you can’t climb down. Listen to your intuition.”

- Climbing has shown me that I am all of these things: strong and weak, brave and cowardly, both immune to and at the mercy of the fear of death, all at the same time.

- Risk is the fee to learn these lessons. The cost is not negotiable. It is a price that, for now, I pay gladly.

- Alex glances at my gear and grabs my lime-green ice hammer. “Cool. Piranhas. These things are great!” Piranhas are made by Simond, an uncommon French ice tool and crampon company whose reputation seems to rest on the fact that their factory is based in the capital of alpinism: Chamonix.

- Aid climbing is when you pull directly on gear normally used for fall-protection. Though less pure than free climbing–climbing the rock and ice with your hands and ice tools–it is sometimes necessary.

- I’ve never fallen ice climbing. Ice climbers live by the unwritten rule that the leader must never fall. There are two reasons for the rule. One, the strength of ice screws, hand-drilled into the ice, is notoriously difficult to judge. Two, with so many steel points connected to you, even short falls can result in injury.

- There are many climbers here I know by name and reputation. Barry Blanchard, the godfather of Canadian alpine climbing. Jack Tackle, one of the first to tackle big new routes alpine style in Alaska and a pioneer of ice climbing in Montana. John Sherman, all-around great rock climber and a father of modern bouldering. Joe Josephson, perhaps the hottest ice climber in North America after Alex. And Mark Wilford, one of the world’s best alpinists, rock climbers, ice climbers, and boulderers: a true climber’s climber. Looking at the group, I’m not sure what bothers me more. The fact that half my climbing heroes are in this room, or the fact that they all seem like regular people.

- I was lucky. My right leg will never be the same. But I will pay more attention next time. It’s the easy ground that kills you.

- As I set up the anchor I ache with the day’s effort. The cold and the 20-odd hours of climbing have been costly. Nevertheless I am elated beyond words. I am living my dream, climbing a new route on the King, with two of the Rockies’ best. Barry and Jojo seem confident in my ability to climb securely and quickly through the difficult, complex terrain. That is the ultimate compliment.

- As I belay them across to the ledge, I think about the seriousness of our situation. We are 4,000 feet up a north face; the temperature is quickly dropping towards–20 degrees. We finished the last of our water four hours ago and a north wind is picking up, threatening to freeze our exposed faces. Despite this, I’m really having fun. I am exceeding my own expectations. Worries about dying, or getting injured have dissolved in the momentum of the climbing.

- Just then Barry pulls onto the belay ledge. With his head bent upward, he takes two blind steps, and sinks to his knees in the snow. “Doesn’t look good,” Barry says. “Not good at all. No cracks. No cracks, no gear.” “No gear, no go.” I finish the little mantra. It’s the same mantra Alex taught me in Cody. As long as you can get gear in, there’s no harm in going for it.

- I’m hesitant to give up so easily on our main objective, but it obviously isn’t possible without going back down, bringing a bolt kit, and drilling holes in the rock, which none of us are willing to do. Reinhold Messner famously derided such tactics as the “murder of the impossible.” Uncertainty is the essence of alpinism; ignoring that destroys the experience.

- As he unpacks his gear later that evening he dons his climbing helmet and asks rhetorically, “How do you get an old guy to climb hard?” Barry chuckles with anticipation as he raises a delicate glass of Scotch whisky to his lips, sips, and then takes the bait. “I don’t know, man. How?” “You put a gun to his head.” Scott says, pointing to the sticker of a black Glock nine-millimeter handgun on the right side on his blaze-red helmet. His laugh bursts from his open mouth with such force, I start laughing too.

- “You’re wrong Scott about one thing.” I counter, pointing at Barry with my own scotch. “I don’t think Barry really is done.” “Nope,” pipes in Barry, tapping his heel on the carpet and looking at the sleeping dog stretched at his feet. “If I had been born a hundred years earlier, I would have been hunting buffalo on the plains. Hunting, working for my own survival is, as near as I can tell, just like alpinism. And though it’s true that I’m getting older, I still like to hunt.”

- After I’d soloed the new route Beauty Is a Rare Thing, on Denali in 1996, Scott, whom I had not yet met, labeled me in the climbing press as “the great white hope of American alpinism.” Like many of his monikers, it unfortunately stuck.

- The wall rears up to vertical. I’m standing on a kind of snow-ice, sometimes called snice. It starts as snow that is deposited on the wall during storms, then by slow melt-freeze cycles, it hardens. Sometimes it’s climbable; sometimes it just looks climbable.

- Whenever I lead, whether it be climbing up or rappelling down, I feel the weight of responsibility for my partners and by extension the hopes and fear of those who love them.

- Conrad Anker turns the corner, his eyes meeting mine. Conrad was caught in the same avalanche as Alex and Dave Bridges. Conrad ran to the right, Alex and Dave went straight. Conrad lived, Alex and Dave died. He and I first met in Cody, Wyoming, the time I climbed with Alex. We have not climbed together.

- Luck is nothing of which to be proud. Each of these cold, tired deaths could have been–might still be–mine. Ultimately, survival in the big mountains depends upon a great measure of luck. Where is the pride in that?

- This is the seventh person in 12 hours to inform us of the obviously talented National Outdoor Leadership School instructors’ climb. “Listen,” Scott starts in. Mark and I fold our arms across our chests and flank the victim; I catch Mark suppressing a grin. “We’re here because we care about our experience and our ethic.” Scott punches towards the ground with his index finger. “We’re here to climb the Slovak in a single push. We’re here to do the hardest route on the mountain faster, with less equipment, and with the greatest commitment. We’re willing to put ourselves in harm’s way for our ideal.” Not pausing, and not releasing the man’s gaze, Scott continues, pushing his finger into his own chest. “Personally, I think it’s great that those guys did the second ascent. It took them eight days, right?” A small nod. “Perfect. That’ll be the counterpoint to us, if we do it, because we’re going to do it in two days.”

- This year, Mark, Scott and I start with the obligatory acclimatization on the West Buttress Route. The park service recruits us again: a 62-year-old climber with cracked ribs and the onset of pneumonia needs to be evacuated from the 17,200-foot camp. Back in the tent that night, after helping to make the rescue in eight hours round trip, Mark asks, “Why do I enjoy doing that? Why do I like being good at it?” I look at him, locking eyes, and expecting him to see what I see. When he doesn’t, I answer, “Because it further justifies your elitist attitude.”

- Mark is among the best, and best-known, alpine climbers in the world. When I was a senior in high school I read his article, “The Rise and Fall of the American Alpinist,” in which he argued that the destitute state of American alpinism stemmed from failures of training and will. Americans sucked in the big mountains because they didn’t train in the Canadian Rockies, they didn’t climb with Canadian or European partners, and they didn’t attempt big alpine style routes in the Himalaya. Now, 10 years later, I wonder if I have subconsciously molded my life in an effort to disprove Mark’s thesis. I am about to meet one of my avatars. I worry that I might not be able to meet his gaze.

- At 6 am we leave the tent, climbing solo–an opening act of trust that seeds confidence. By 8 am we have passed the Slovak’s second bivouac. We stop to belay and I take both ropes and tie in to lead. We plan to take turns, each leading six pitches. At 11 am I belay near the Slovak’s third bivy. We’ve done in five hours what took them three days. Our belief in what we’re attempting is fortified.

- We sit with our backs to the rock. After 10 minutes the first of the stoves hisses away the last of its fuel. It’s hour 48. Mark reaches over and turns the other one off. “I can’t listen to that again.” I twist left to regard him and see that we have reverted into separate entities now. We are turtles in our separate shells. I am reminded of Greg Childs’ comment about climbing K2: “Up here, where we need each other most, it is every man for himself.”

- “This is it,” Scott says, with a slight waver to his usually forceful voice. “Put up, shut up, and maybe die trying.” He laughs. Scott is back, or as back as he can be. The sunrise, though surely beautiful, inspires no poetics, just thoughts of survival.

- The inspiration for George Lowe and Michael Kennedy naming this route the Infinite Spur after its first ascent in 1977 is quite obvious. They belayed 90 pitches over 11 days, and averaged 14 hours of climbing a day. I shiver at the thought of climbing with a fully-loaded pack. My pack started out weighing 12 pounds. Between Rolo and I, we’re carrying a stove, a quart of fuel, a small titanium pot, 40 GU energy gels each, eight packages of instant soup, some halvah, a map, compass, altimeter, GPS, radio, one 8.8 mm rope, some ice screws and rock gear, my emergency tarp, and our Polarguard parkas.

- Draining the bottle, I feel hungry and wonder what Rolo is cooking. “Pizza ready?” I ask, stepping into the tent. Rolo turns from the stove and smiles. “Gosh. No, pizza is sold out. Today’s special is ramen noodles.” “That was yesterday’s special.” “Yes. And tomorrow’s I think.” Rolo laughs, handing me a bowl. The soup is hot and tastes good.

- I write in my journal, musing on the despondent state of my marriage of eight years. As I struggle to transition to climbing bigger mountains–ramping up my commitment to train harder and work harder to pay for the longer, more expensive expeditions–my relationship with Anne has grown difficult. I am a goal-oriented achiever, which has left little energy for my marriage.

- Marko calls home, talking to his young wife, Katja and his two boys: Bor who is four years old and Tim who is nine. Katja is a trained chemical engineer, but the current job market in Slovenia is so dismal that it is best for family finances if she stays home to raise the boys. Marko is immune from homesickness. When I question him on this he answers, “When I am on expedition, I am on expedition. When I am home, I am home. End of story.”

- I stare at the striking pillar of Masherbrum’s north face. It’s a fantastic line, one of the best in the big mountains. It’s as big as the south face of Nuptse, and a purer line than the Slovak Direct. Masherbrum’s summit has only been reached five times since its first ascent 40 years ago.

- Eventually my thoughts turn to the place I’m traveling to. It becomes difficult to feel sorry for myself. Without a partner to pursue what Mark, Scott and I experienced on the Slovak Direct, it seems logical that I might find the same sensation, the same wholeness within myself. Climbing is the only vehicle I have to achieve that odd sensation of both emptiness and fullness where I no longer feel alone.

- My stomach growls at the thought of a hot lunch on the safety of the glacier. Should I give up now without demonstrating to myself that the climbing is really too hard? “What do I need?” I ask myself. Do I need to fall off? Do I need to push beyond what I can do in order to learn what I can’t do? It would be stupid to fall up here, belayed to a clove hitch on that 8-millimeter half rope. No matter how much you can live inside your own head right now, no matter how skilled you are at distracting yourself from exertion and discomfort with fantasies, you won’t be able to divorce yourself from the real pain of a serious injury. No day-dream will stop the blood flowing from your skull once it’s cracked open. Do you have an answer to that? Of course not. You knew all of that when you came up here; so what’s changed? Nothing. Nothing has changed. Just up or down. What’s it going to be? Up or down?

- I start climbing in the predawn gray. The ice disappears where the rock steepens and I change to rock-climbing shoes. The climbing gets steeper with each passage and suddenly I’m on terrain too hard to be soloing. I’ve read that a samurai endeavors to make every decision within the space of seven breaths. By the sixth breath I have an anchor placed and am rappelling down.

- I stuff a bivy sack, an old pair of down pants and my lime-green DAS Parka into my backpack. It all weighs 11 pounds. This is usually the point where I dump it all back out and go through each item checking that each has multiple uses, that every item is essential. Nothing weighs more than a few ounces, but ounces make pounds. And pounds, as they say, make pain.

- A month ago I left behind my home, my wife of nine years, and our beloved avalanche-search dog. I bought an ‘84 Ford van, packed my most important belongings, and said good-bye. Forever. At 25, when I wed Anne on a rainy November day, I believed true love to be self-sustaining. I don’t understand why my thesis failed, but staring at 4,000 feet of black limestone reminds me that these mountains may be my solace and my curse. Purpose has its price, but it wasn’t just the time apart; I’ve always needed that. In the last six months, I realized that with Anne I am no longer capable of the intimacy I seek. Our failure to communicate our needs to one another buried us under years of resentment and judgment. I know, from climbing, that a deep connection between people is possible and that is what I want in a relationship.

- I retrieve the one bit of extra clothing that we have allowed ourselves: dry socks. With dry socks we can sleep with warm toes, and by stuffing my damp pair next to my inner most layers of clothing they will be dry in the morning.

- I have one rule for my soloing: never climb alone because I don’t have a partner. Soloing must be a journey into a solitary, egoless universe. Whether my efforts result in something my fellow climbers perceive as success or failure is irrelevant.

- Success, when achieved, is deceptive–for there lies praise, closure, achievement. Failure is the more valuable fruit, borne as it is from the knurled vine of process.

- Taking up crampons and ice axes after failure forces me to own my shortcomings, learn from them, and to capitalize on the strengths that I found.

- With partners I have pitched and belayed my way up some of the biggest walls in the world. In all those thousands of pitches I’ve fallen only once. What security did the rope really bring? It provided us the confidence to try, to act. By joining together we became stronger because we fought together, because we fought for one another. At the moment of greatest commitment, when we had to climb up and off the mountain to survive, the rope became true partnership.

- The Piolet d’Or–Golden Ice Axe–is the climbing world’s pre-eminent and longest running prize. The Oscar of climbing, it was created in 1991 by the Groupe de Haute Montagne, an invitation-only alpine club based in France, and the French outdoors magazine, Montagnes. Their intention was to create an award for “the year’s most important alpine performance.”

- I was surprised when they chose me. Six months ago, in a widely circulated editorial, I castigated the Piolet d’Or regarding the 2004 winners, writing: “This (the 2004 award) accomplishes two things. Most sadly, it publicizes an ascent that was accomplished using a style that made the ascent irrelevant to contemporary alpine climbing. Secondly, it demonstrates to me, and to others, that the present Piolet d’Or award is so badly out of touch with alpinism that the award itself has become irrelevant.” The winners that year were two Russian climbers who fixed ropes on Nuptse, a sister peak of Everest. They had gone back three successive seasons, fixing ropes and leaving them for the next season’s attempt. After their ascent they rappelled the ropes, leaving them all in place, along with all of their tents, food, fuel, and equipment that they didn’t need on the descent.

- I am gliding, buoyed by hope mixed with the ever-present fear of failure. I wonder about Vince. Though our friendship spans 10 years, we have not climbed more than a day route together. I am tense about having committed to an unknown partner. Flatland friendship is based on what we tell each other–much of it unverifiable. Each creates the image we want to project, who we think the other would want us to be.

- Climbing partners can be as, or more, intimate than spouses. Over the next few days I will come to know Vince as few know him. Climbing big mountains exposes us. For this we must go, try, discover.

- I have been shaped by 16 years and a million decisions made: what I learned, how well I trained, when we went, how long we waited for good weather, for good conditions, where we chose to climb. The sum of my past actions doesn’t determine who I am, but it certainly determines who I may become.

- In that moment, I understand that on the outer edge of infinity lies nothingness, that in the instant I achieve my objective, and discover my true self, both are lost.

- “How does it feel to have done this amazing climb?” she asks. Now someone has my attention. “Good question.” I look at Vince in case he wants to take it. He gives me a “good luck buddy” glance, and I turn back to the audience. I know the answer to this one. “Honestly, it feels empty. I’ve been having a really hard time since we’ve been back. I think that this was such a huge goal for me, and such a long journey to get to the point where I could even consider climbing the Rupal Face, that instead of feeling relieved, or…” I pause, searching for the right word, “happy, I feel kind of, well, I feel lost.”

- “Steve,” comes a voice from the back row. Jeff Lowe, one of the most active and forward looking American alpinists to ever live, and the founder of this festival, stands up with difficulty. He leans on a cane, necessitated by his battle with multiple sclerosis. The room becomes quiet. “You shouldn’t feel bad. I know that climbing Nanga Parbat was guiding your compass. I’ve been there. I understand what you’re going through, or at least close to it. But you’ve done a great thing. And you’ve brought it back to share with all of us. And that’s wonderful.” The crowd applauds enthusiastically.

- When I adopted my mission, atop a boulder in far northern Pakistan 19 years ago–to be the best climber I could become–I couldn’t have foreseen the implications that decision would have. I abandoned a nascent science career and became a mountain guide. I have lived in vans and been so broke and hungry that I checked into foreign hotels, billed meals to my room, and walked into the night at 4 am, carrying a backpack containing all my belongings, the unglued sole of my boot slapping softly in the cold night. I have fathered no children. I’ve burned through my emotions and left inadequate reserves for a marriage. I have trained for thousands of hours: hiked, run, sprinted, lugged 40 pounds of water uphill, bounded, pedaled, skied, and lifted. I have climbed, and climbed, and climbed. Four, five, sometimes seven days a week. I have pushed to my limits and beyond. I’ve taken twisted pleasure in dedicating my life to a sport where only a few survive. In my less virtuous moments, I’ve reveled in the gulf between my commitment to my sport and my worldly successes. At my nadir I have criticized the accomplishments of others in order to lift myself up. These transgressions too, are part of who I am today.

- Every climb ends, as does every life. And each ends where it began: on the ground, and eventually, in the ground. We always return again and again to earth, the beginning. The sum always equals zero.

- I also crave evidence of existence. Yukio Mishima wrote that although the core of the apple exists, you cannot see it from the outside. The only way to prove the core’s existence is to cut the apple open. When the apple, or the body, bleeds, and dies the existence of the core is confirmed. I have cut open this metaphorical apple on a thousand climbs. I have seen beauty, have wept with joy; I have been astonished, and been horrified to the core.

- We should not be blamed for thinking our undertakings beautiful and grand, for they are. Meaning is born from struggle, and each of us has our own unique battle. My truths are not universal, which is one reason they are so difficult to express. My ice axe may be your paintbrush. One man’s Slovak Direct is another’s West Buttress.
