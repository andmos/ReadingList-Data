### Highlights

- Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: The last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.

- When we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves.

- Those who have a 'why' to live, can bear with almost any 'how'.

- But there was no need to be ashamed of tears, for tears bore witness that a man had the greatest of courage, the courage to suffer.

- An abnormal reaction to an abnormal situation is normal behavior.

- In some ways suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning, such as the meaning of a sacrifice.

- No man should judge unless he asks himself in absolute honesty whether in a similar situation he might not have done the same.

- Happiness cannot be pursued; it must ensue.
