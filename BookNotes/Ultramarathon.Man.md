### Highlights

- When asked why he was attempting to be the first to climb Mount Everest, George Mallory offered the famously laconic, ‘Because it’s there.’

- Running gave me a sense of freedom and exploration that school never did. School was about sitting still and trying to behave as someone explained what the world was like. Running was about going out and experiencing it firsthand.

- If it comes easy, if it doesn’t require extraordinary effort, you’re not pushing hard enough: It’s supposed to hurt like hell.

- It was an exciting time to be a runner. Running was experiencing a huge spike in popularity, and Nike forever changed the sport with the introduction of the first air-sole cushioning system. The waffle tread had been the gold standard in trainers, but air-sole technology ushered in a whole new level of comfort and pizzazz. I remember my first pair of Tailwinds like I remember my first crush, the way they felt in my hand, the smell of the rubberized outsoles. Watching Gilligan’s Island reruns in the evening, I’d spend the entire episode twisting and crunching the shoes to break them in.

- Running is about finding your inner peace, and so is a life well lived.

- As the years rolled by, however, the job pressures began to mount, and the car payments and hefty mortgage didn’t help. Suddenly, work was stressing me out. The long hours and the travel were becoming mundane. At first it was glamorous, but somewhere among all the meetings, dinners, and cocktail receptions, I became aware of an inner hollowness. Something was missing in my life. Work wasn’t providing the satisfaction that I had always thought it would. So what if I had an MBA and was pulling in six figures a year? There was an emptiness that my career didn’t fulfill. I began to secretly long to fill this void, even though I wasn’t sure what it was or how it could be filled.

- How could I be thirty? Where had the years gone? At that moment I realized that my life was being wasted. Disillusioned with the trappings of the corporate scene, the things that really mattered—friendship and exploration, personal expansion and a sense of meaning—had gotten all twisted around making a lot of money and buying stuff. I hungered for a place where I could explore nature and my capabilities, away from a corporate office in a corporate building in a big city with crowded supermalls and people judging me by the car I drove (which, of course, was a new Lexus). What I needed was some breathing room to figure things out. Some space to determine what really mattered to me. I needed a chance to clear my vision and look at the world through fresh eyes.

- Every devout runner has an awakening. We know the place, the time, and the reason we accepted running into our life. After half a lifetime, I’d been reborn. Most runners are able to keep a rational perspective on the devotion, and practice responsibly. I couldn’t, and became a fanatic.

- Endurance is a relative term. Some might think a marathon, at 26.2 miles, with its two to five hours of continuous pounding to the body, is the ultimate test of human endurance. Hills make the undertaking all the more demanding; the Boston Marathon, for example, includes the infamous ‘Heartbreak Hill,’ a climb of 280 vertical feet. That’s nearly the length of a football field straight up into the air. It’s the vertical equivalent of climbing one quarter of the way to the top of the Empire State Building. Heartbreak Hill can be a demoralizing obstacle that forces many runners into submission, and they walk. For an ultra-elite group of athletes, however, a single marathon is child’s play. The challenges these individuals seek are beyond comprehension, bordering on psychotic. They participate in endeavors so physically demanding that some have perished in the act.

- To complete the Western States, you must transform yourself into a human machine.

- Training so intensely required sacrifices in other areas of my life. A good athlete might be able to fake his way through a 10K, or perhaps even a marathon, but there’s no running fifty miles without having paid your dues. I would get up well before dawn to run before work. Anywhere I traveled, either for work or pleasure, my running shoes came along. If there was a break in my day, even for forty-five minutes, I was out the door for a ‘quick pop,’ followed by a speedy sponge bath in the men’s room, and then back into my suit for the next meeting.

- To call running ‘fun’ would be a misuse of the word. Running can be ‘enjoyable.’ Running can be ‘rejuvenating.’ But in a pure sense of the word, running is not fun.

- Being a champion meant not quitting, no matter how tough the situation became, and no matter how badly the odds seemed stacked against you. If you had the courage, stamina, and persistence to cross the finish line, you were a champion.

- As Lily Tomlin said, ‘Exercise is for people who can’t handle drugs and alcohol.’

- I’d also come to recognize that the simplicity of running was quite liberating. Modern man has virtually everything one could desire, but too often we’re still not fulfilled. ‘Things’ don’t bring happiness. Some of my finest moments came while running down the open road, little more than a pair of shoes and shorts to my name. A runner doesn’t need much. Thoreau once said that a man’s riches are based on what he can do without. Perhaps in needing less, you’re actually getting more.

- Adventure is worthwhile in itself.—AMELIA EARHART

- One either made it to the top of the mountain or failed. Simple as that. Life is rarely so neatly defined. Goals are often ambiguous and elusive. Seldom do people know exactly what is required of them to succeed. Often we think we’re moving in the right direction only to learn that the rules have changed. As daunting as it would be to run for twenty to thirty hours straight, at least I knew what was expected of me. There would be a starting line, and 100 miles from that a finish line. All I needed to do was run from here to there. No ambiguity about it. ‘We are at home in our games because it is the only place we know just what we are supposed to do,’ Albert Camus once said.

- That which does not kill you makes you stronger.—FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE

- Long-distance running requires a certain discretion and reserve. It’s easy to let your ego get the better of you early on and run beyond your means. It’s a mistake that may haunt you as the miles and the hours add up. One of my biggest challenges in this early stage would be to have the discipline to go slow, even as other runners passed me. And I hated being passed.

- It has been said of the Western States Endurance Run that you run the first 50 miles with your legs, and the last 50 miles with your mind.

- When exhaustion sets in, the mind often rationalizes the irrational.

- Fear, I thought to myself, just another four-letter word; but now as great an adversary as any mountain left before me. From here on in, the battle would be within.

- What counts in battle is what you do when the pain sets in.—JOHN SHORT

- After running 65 miles, you begin to lose touch with your body. The normal systems that monitor and transmit critical data to the brain begin to disintegrate and malfunction. The body starts playing tricks on the mind. Important physiological information is often communicated in sporadic pulses of pain that show up unannounced. Under normal circumstances, you would have at least some hint of the mounting tension, but after running 65 miles straight, your early warning signals become useless. One minute you’re running along feeling satisfactory; the very next you’re abruptly delivered a life-altering muscle cramp without warning.

- There was a long moment of silence, and then the Indian chief began to speak. ‘That is to be expected,’ he said, continuing to scan the sky. ‘Pain is the body’s way of ridding itself of weakness.’

- That’s when I knew I was going blind. It’s called nyctalopia, or night blindness. It can be caused by lowered blood pressure or exposure to bright light during the day. The body’s capacity to produce a chemical compound called rhodopsin, or visual purple, which is necessary for the perception of objects in dim light, is temporarily impaired. The

- Most dreams die a slow death. They’re conceived in a moment of passion, with the prospect of endless possibility, but often languish and are not pursued with the same heartfelt intensity as when first born. Slowly, subtly, a dream becomes elusive and ephemeral. People who’ve let their own dreams die become pessimists and cynics. They feel that the time and devotion spent on chasing their dreams were wasted. The emotional scars last forever. ‘It can’t be done,’ they’ll say, when you describe your dream, ‘You’ll never make it.’

- Medical analysis of blood samples taken from previous Western States participants has shown that some muscle destruction occurs in all runners. The harder one pushes, the deeper one digs, the more extensive the damage can be.

- Twenty-four of us were about to embark on what is called The World’s Toughest Footrace—a 135-mile trek across Death Valley to Mount Whitney, the highest peak in the contiguous United States. While the Western States 100-Mile Endurance Run had been grueling, Badwater is widely considered the ultimate test of endurance and human resolve. Or just plain insanity. It can go either way.

- Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far they can go.—T. S. ELIOT

- running, to me, remained the purest form of athletic expression. It was the simplest, least encumbered sport there was, and the definitive measurement of raw stamina.

- How fitting that Ernest Shackleton’s 1914 to 1916 expedition to be the first to cross Antarctica, one of the greatest survival stories of all time, was in a ship called Endurance. It’s also sobering to remember that the Antarctic ice floes crushed and sank the legendary vessel before it got very far.

- When it’s cold beyond comprehension, you start losing your natural instincts. Am I freezing? No, things are fine. Wait a minute, I can’t feel my toes! Should I stop? When the temperatures are so low, just a few minutes of poor judgment can cost body parts.

- It’d been a month since I’d heard a bird sing, and I realized that going close to the edge gives you a newfound appreciation of the familiar. Nothing gets taken for granted, and you see the world through fresh eyes. Running beyond the limits was my form of renewal.

- Runners are real people. They don’t run for money or recognition, they do it out of passion. Most have day jobs that pay the bills, and running is a labor of love. Ultrarunners take it to the next level. Training to run 100 miles while working nine-to-five requires a phenomenal level of commitment and determination. It’s a select breed that can withstand the tremendous physical and emotional toll that performing on such a level demands. Without discipline to rise before dawn and pound out the miles, you’ll never make it. If the fire in your heart isn’t strong, there’s no point trying.

- Somewhere along the line we seem to have confused comfort with happiness. I’ve now come to believe that quite the opposite is the case. Dostoyevsky had it right: ‘Suffering is the sole origin of consciousness.’ Never are my senses more engaged than when the pain sets in. There is magic in misery. Just ask any runner.

- Heat is the runner’s enemy. Running generates tremendous internal heat and forces the body to work doubly hard to keep the muscles cool. When outside temperatures rise, the stress on the body is multiplied.

- When you’re going through hell, keep going.—WINSTON CHURCHILL

- most people can’t imagine the levels of pain one endures running long distances. Most of us have run at some point in our lives and know how much it can hurt. And I’m here to tell you that it doesn’t get any less painful the farther you go. Quite the contrary.

- ‘Adventure happens the moment you step out your front door. Get outside and get going,’

- ‘The natural situation for man may well be at war,’ Emerson wrote.

- The highest form of competition is self-competition,

- Success seems to be largely a matter of hanging on after others have let go.—WILLIAM FEATHER

- I wasn’t born with any innate talent. I’ve never been naturally gifted at anything; I always had to work at it. The only way I knew to succeed was to try harder than anyone else. Dogged persistence is what got me through life.

- As you progress in a long race, your highs become higher and your lows lower, and the fluctuations come with escalating rapidity. It was like squeezing the emotional drama of a lifetime into two days.

- If there’s one thing that can ease your own personal suffering, it’s the sight of someone else suffering even worse.

- I now saw the value of having the right training partner. Misery loves company.

- You only live once, but if you work it right, once is enough.—JOE LOUIS

- Running has taught me that the pursuit of a passion matters more than the passion itself. Immerse yourself in something deeply and with heartfelt intensity—continually improve, never give up—this is fulfillment, this is success.

- Life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well-preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming: ‘WOW!! What a ride!’

- Happiness, though, cannot be measured in monetary terms. My job paid the bills; my running satisfied a deeper passion. Limping into the weekly meeting, dehydrated, stiff, and on the verge of collapse, my heart was fulfilled. I couldn’t ask for anything more.

- Runs end. Running doesn’t.—UNKNOWN RUNNER

- Dr. Shapiro, who has become a dear friend, once said to me, ‘The gift of life is always bittersweet,’ meaning that with organ donation, for one life to be saved, another must slip away.
