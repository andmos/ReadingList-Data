### Highlights

- At least his boots were holding up. He’d learned long ago during his travels: skimp on shirts if you must, but never on footwear.

- In Nomad’s experience, it wasn’t when life was utterly terrible that people rebelled. It instead happened when life improved to the point that people had time to think, time to wonder. The capacity to imagine. So maybe things here had recently progressed enough to make people wonder if they needed a dictator or not.

- She seems comforted, the knight notes, even though the squire didn’t say anything actually helpful. “Knowing you aren’t strange,” he explained in Alethi, “is helpful. Knowing others felt like you did. Sometimes it’s the only thing that is helpful.”

- “Your planet shouldn’t have different countries. You should have conquered and unified it all.” “Conquest doesn’t remove countries,” Nomad said. “It removes lines on a map. Unity requires something else.”

- “I’m an idiot,” he muttered. Now, now, the knight says. You’re not an idiot, Nomad. An idiot is someone without knowledge or ability. You’re something else: a person with knowledge or ability who misuses it. That makes you a fool instead.

- “When I was first given a spear,” he said, “I didn’t know how to hold it. I didn’t even know how to stand. Each time I sparred, I had to dedicate all my thoughts to standing correctly. The more I did it, the more natural that stance became. It’s like… I didn’t just learn the lesson, I internalized it. That left my conscious mind free to think about something else. Since my body now stood properly on its own, I could wonder about how I held the spear. “Then that grip became natural, so I could focus on thrusting with precision. I could learn to change my grip, resetting my stance so that I was oriented toward the enemy. Each of these things slowly became instinct. Through deliberate practice—to learn that specific thing. And each time, once internalized, that left my mind free to try something else.

- “You’re needed,” he said, reaching for her chained wrist. “I’m not ready!” she said. “I can’t control it.” “A lesson for you,” he said. “You never get to be ready. You just have to move forward anyway. That’s something Kaladin taught me.”

- “You know the problem,” Zellion said, “with ruling by tyranny? There’s always someone stronger.”
