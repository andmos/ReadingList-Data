### Highlights

- Four years separated my climb of Matterhorn and Everest, but mostly what separated them was my realization that I was living a life of contradictions. I ran fast to live a slow lifestyle. I needed solitude to be myself and social interactions to make a living. I loved the adrenaline of a race and the calm of the world above 8,000 meters. I enjoyed discovering remote mountains, but to protect them, I now realize it might have been better if I hadn’t visited them at all. I am those contradictions, and how I deal with them is also who I am. There will always be consequences to my actions, positive or negative, and those consequences might affect only myself or affect a large amount of people.

- Mountains are (still) a space of freedom, where lawlessness reigns for the good of everyone.

- How many steps are considered effort enough to claim an ascent? What I’ve learned is that every shortcut is a personal decision you must live with, and every achievement is the same.

- When it comes to climbing mountains, the reaching should never compromise the journey to get there. That’s why when I climbed Everest, I did it alone with no assistance—not to simply step on the summit but to see what I was able to endure in my journey getting there.

- I feel at peace in the mountains because, as Italian mountaineer Reinhold Messner said, they are not fair or unfair; they are just dangerous. And, in danger, you can apply a certain logic when it comes to making what you think will be the right decision. In the mountains, I never waver, but in the more jagged terrain of relationships, I am paralyzed.

- Intercontinental flights are like a long trip to a mall in a large city. There are always children crying and teenagers whispering, letting out the occasional scream or guffaw. Bad food, shiny offers for products you’ll never use, and movies, music, or games—it doesn’t matter which—to pass the time.

- There are people who train to compete, and there are those who compete to train.

- “You have to stop doing miles just for the sake of it, and climbing mountains with no rhyme or reason. You have to treat it like a job. Imagine you’re building up credit,” he said, “to use the day you really want to go fast.”

- We can’t choose our genes or our build, and they’ll be with us for our whole lives. But they’re far from enough in determining who will be successful. Natural predisposition should always be accompanied by hard work and passion.

- I had no doubt, from the moment I decided to dedicate my life to sports, that for some doors to open for me, others would have to close forever.

- To me, sport doesn’t mean a life full of sacrifices but rather one full of choices. You make choices about where you want to go, and the secret lies in prioritizing what you really want to do and sticking to the plan you’ve made without hesitation.

- If we have to accept that extreme sports are unhealthy because we take our bodies to the limit and run the risk of injury, we should also be clear that we must be the ones to manage our own bodies and that they should always be under our control. When we’re guided by our basic urges, we’ve already lost. If we’re not in control of what we do, the sport loses its beauty and leads us into a downward spiral that can plunge us into the darkness of depression or illnesses like bulimia and anorexia. In extreme cases, we lose our sense of the meaning of life and throw it away. Sadly, this continues to be a taboo topic in the sports world, but it needs to be brought out into the open.

- You have to be fast to win races, but that alone isn’t enough to make you competitive. You must be aware that you can’t overcome your body’s physiological limits. On the other hand, if you want to do as well as possible, what you can do is build up an armor made of different pieces: mental preparation, technique, the kind of equipment you use, and your strategy. Your body possesses immense knowledge and, when necessary, sends signals asking you if you want to keep going or not. Those warning bells are called fainting, leg pain, hallucinations, and vomiting.

- There is one more limit, a psychological one. This one is called fear. It’s a great travel companion and has two sides. On the one hand, if you ignore it, you can overcome all your psychological obstacles and gain a true understanding of how far you can go. On the other, if you don’t learn how to listen to it, it can end up leading you into an abyss. You must assess which is the better partner to dance with.

- When you work with the body, nothing you win ever belongs to you or lasts forever, since you always have to keep training just as hard, to keep the bar as high as you want it to be.

- I believe that children should be coached not to win but to train. If this were the general pattern, everyone would have their slice of delicious cake, and the competition would just be the cherry on top.

- Interpreting all this data is a complex task that requires me to keep my feet on the ground. I have to be as honest as I can in my notes. If I’m not, a few years from now, when I want to know why I did so well in a given week, everything I might extrapolate from these records would be wrong. Despite the fact that I’m the only person who reads this document, sometimes it’s hard to avoid falling into the trap of false modesty or overvaluation.

- If you want to be an elite runner, you’ll probably accumulate a lot of frustration along the way plus put in a lot of effort that will largely go unnoticed and result in few rewards. In the end, the most valuable prize will be bringing out the best in yourself. If this isn’t enough of a reward, then it’s best to leave it, because you won’t see the point of dedicating your life to difficult, endless training in pursuit of perfection. You won’t understand why you should suffer so many injuries, follow such a strict diet, and deprive yourself of so many things. And all this without being able to take a vacation, because the life you have chosen fills every hour of every day. For decades.

- In pre-internet society, it was still possible to seek long-term results in life. Today, it’s practically impossible to find anyone who sets themselves a long-term goal without the certainty of attaining it, since in order to survive, we need our basic needs met. And without knowing exactly how we got here, we have ended up believing that we have far too many basic needs. We live in an era when the memory of a self-sufficient past still endures, when people grew their own food or hunted, built their own houses, and figured out ways to stay healthy. In that context, money wasn’t much of a necessity. But this has no place in the unbridled capitalism of the present, when we are unaccustomed to distinguishing between the money we need for basic day-to-day survival and the money we want to use for pleasure. From this point of view, office or factory work isn’t so different from what an athlete does who trains by running up and down mountains; the economic goal is the same. That’s why we must decide if we want to earn a living with work that provides a dose of passion, or if we want to prostitute ourselves a little with some other job that we don’t like as much but that fills our pockets.

- I never stopped to think about what kind of runner I wanted to be. And this was essential for knowing what kind of training regimen I would have to follow in the long term. Did I want to be a long-distance runner? Would I rather be a ski mountaineer? Maybe one who competed every week? Or would it be better to be one of those who put themselves to the test a couple of times a year, but with impeccable training? Before anything else, I had to ask myself what kind of runner I admired most: one who can run a marathon in just over two hours, like the Kenyan runner Eliud Kipchoge, or one who can compete in over twenty races a year at an extremely high level, like the Japanese runner Yuki Kawauchi? Jeez. If I thought about total performance, Kipchoge; if I focused on recovery, Kawauchi. A big dilemma. I admire both of these runners; each of them is equally inspiring. But what about me? I like to perform to my full potential, but at the same time, I don’t want this to be detrimental to the other aspects of my activities. How much do I want to risk quality to increase quantity? This question makes my head begin to spin. On one hand, I want to keep fighting to win ski-mountaineering races, like the Pierra Menta, the Fully Vertical Kilometer, a 100-mile Ultra-Trail, or the Zegama marathon, and I don’t want to stop participating in some to focus on others. On the other hand, I can’t avoid the fact that today’s runners are more specialized, and I don’t know if I can stay competitive in all these areas at the same time. Despite everything, my mind wanders freely, and I have realized that for the time being, I’m not as excited about competition as I used to be. I see it as a kind of training. Yes, but what am I training for? And it’s tough to leave the throne explicitly so others can occupy it, because it’s really nice to occupy it yourself.

- Even though I know that one life contains many, for me it’s a tragedy that we keep living just one, when its time is up.

- Climbing a mountain is just putting your life in danger to try to reach the summit, and then coming down again. Clearly, this puts you in a category closer to stupidity than to heroism.

- The backpack of our experiences should be a tool kit full of resources, but all too often it’s nothing but a dead weight that doesn’t allow us to fly freely.

- There is no single landscape I can call mine. I cannot point and say, “That’s my house, between the mountain path to the north and the valley to the south.” There are many places where I feel more or less at home, but none that I consider completely mine.

- My childhood dreams are at odds with the reality of Chamonix, where I lived a big part of my life during the 2010s. For reasons of size and diversity, the men and women there gather according to their sense of belonging to a tribe, and being part of a group makes them think that some are better than others. Without my having asked, I was included in the gang of Ultra-Trailers. Though I never picked up my membership card, I also never bothered to try to remove the label that was given to me.

- It was during one of those trips to the Écrins that I began to realize what kind of mountain I like to climb. I wasn’t drawn to difficulty since it seemed too slow; classic mountaineering seemed too laborious. Racing and ski mountaineering are both activities I love but in which I miss the spirit of discovery and adventure. Continuous movement on technical terrain, though, gives me enormous enjoyment, in an unusual way. The French mountaineer Georges Livanos said that the essential thing wasn’t to climb at a high speed but to climb for a long time. While I agree with the second part of this statement, if you climb at a high speed and for a long time, you can see much more. What made me fall in love with traversing mountains at high speed is the synergy that emerges between the body’s movement and the shapes of nature, the feeling it gives me of being naked and inconsequential, unrestrained. It brings me freedom and connection, something I can’t find if I go to the mountains any other way. At the same time, when it comes to making certain decisions, it creates a very fine line between the conscious acceptance of certain risks and stupidity. And I can say that I have sometimes crossed that line.

- I took out the phone and dialed the number of the PGHM, the Peloton de Gendarmerie de Haute Montagne—the French Alps emergency rescue team. As I did so, I was already starting to think about what that call would mean. Although I thought the people in Chamonix who’d always criticized me for traveling so light would crucify me, I understood that their comments would be constructive and would show my followers that the mountains are full of risks, and that strength is no substitute for knowledge and preparation. In the end, the only thing harmed by the criticism was my ego. I had to face up to my mistakes.

- The stopwatch is a companion that tells you you’re doing well, that you’re getting the best you can out of yourself. Though time may not be the ultimate goal, this little device whispers into your ear whether you’re getting better or worse, whether you’re going strong or flagging, or whether you’re being efficient when it comes to solving a problem. The stopwatch doesn’t lie.

- IN THE MOUNTAINS, THE IDEA OF A RECORD IS RELATIVE, SINCE IT’S impossible to compare two times even on the same peak. In track and field, for example, a record has to be set on a track or circuit that guarantees certain conditions (wind, terrain, etc.) and parameters that leave no room to doubt equal opportunity (anti-doping tests, identical aid and provisioning for all participants, etc.). But this is impossible in the mountains, since conditions vary day by day and everyone climbs in a different way. That’s why it’s impossible to speak of records in this field; instead, performance is measured by fastest known time.

- Four basic factors give rise to improvements in time. The first is personal performance, where physical ability, technique, the economy of the race, experience, strategy, and psychological state all play a part. The second is the optimization of the route, in other words, whether you know the difficulties, whether you know the movements, and where you can cut them down. The third is the conditions, given that it’s not the same to practice in bad winter weather as on a sunny summer day. The fourth is the kind of ethic you want to apply, which includes the question of going with or without assistance, alone or in company, the kind of equipment you use, or even whether or not to resort to doping, whether this be mechanical or physiological.

- I DON’T THINK THERE’S A BEST OR WORST STYLE—OR WAY—TO CLIMB A mountain. The purest way is almost impossible, due to our limitations as a species in the natural world. Michael Reardon, one of the most prolific solitary climbers ever, said that if you set out barefoot, without knowing the way, and without any chalk or rope, you can consider yourself to be climbing; everything else is commitment.

- I’m too impatient. I don’t know if that’s a virtue. I admire the approach of those who work hard on details, but I would never make the sacrifice to set a spectacular record or win a victory for the ages if I had to spend a year without doing anything else to achieve it.

- WHEN YOU PREPARE FOR AN EXPEDITION, IT’S IMPORTANT TO GATHER the maximum amount of information before planning an assault on the summit. But there’s no need to exaggerate. If you spend too much of the day studying the weather and waiting for the perfect conditions, you’ll end up thinking that opportunities are passing you by, and that maybe you should take a risk every now and then and go on up. It’s difficult to achieve perfection both in your performance and in the conditions. In the end, you have to learn to set out without worrying so much and struggle along with whatever you get.

- When you’ve repeated this sequence hundreds of times—over five hundred—it loses the charm of a special ceremony and becomes no more than a mechanical, routine way to optimize time. Every once in a while, very sporadically, you get a feeling close to excitement. Yes, I’ve accumulated over five hundred race numbers.

- Short races, those that take one to four hours to cover between 20 and 40 kilometers, demand a high level of concentration. They aren’t anything like the Fully Vertical Kilometer, for example, where one small error can cause you to lose everything and you’re in a perpetual bubble, but they can’t be compared to a long race, either, during which you have to keep pace and hope the exhaustion won’t be too brutal. In these medium-length races, you have to concentrate, that much is true, but even if you make a mistake, you always have enough of a margin to make up for it. You can start running tactically, watch out for the best moment to attack, reserve some moments to rest, or just recover your strength in order to speed up again.

- For a few years, I believed mistakenly that a race was what happened between the starting shot and the finish line. I was blinded by the idea that competition was a binary game between winning and losing, between achieving a good record or a bad one. The need to get the best result prevented me from seeing that the most important thing about Zegama wasn’t the encouragement, or the carb-heavy dinner the night before, but the passion of Alberto and Ainhoa, creators and organizers of the race, for turning that village, those mountains, and that day into a magical time for its inhabitants. Or that the real celebration wasn’t the one on the podium but the one where everyone gathered around a table to talk—runners, organizers, and spectators alike, all having dinner together in the town’s traditional Basque gastronomic club. Or that in Giir di Mont, the competition was less important than the pizzas at Peppa’s place afterward. Not being aware of this was the price I had to pay before I could reach the levels of physical fitness and competitive instinct that have given me the knowledge and the mechanics to achieve success.

- When I compete, I like to be first. I’m the most restless, the most competitive, the most impatient, as you know by now, but at the same time I’m convinced that the satisfaction of victory must be personal and private. I feel a certain aversion to the ostentation of competition. Showing off, taking the stand higher than everyone else, followers and losers, so no one can doubt that we are the best . . . In the end, winning is only internal, individual, inexpressible. It’s the same with defeat. These ceremonies and symbols are what kills competitions.

- This race is the touchstone for all mountain athletes, just as the 100 meters is for high-speed runners, or the 10,000 meters for long-distance runners. Everyone knows approximately how long it might take them to climb 1,000 meters, or how many meters they can cover in an hour-long ascent. These are calculation reference points. “If you climb six hundred meters per hour, it will take almost three hours to reach this peak.” Reinhold Messner calculated that he climbed 1,000 meters in thirty-five or thirty-six minutes, and since the 1990s, increasingly prepared runners, who follow a specific training regimen, have lowered that time.

- When you’re running against yourself, the winner or loser is always internal.

- Some things have to change to progress, while others remain the same and that is exactly their charm, since they transport us to a past when we believed everything was better.

- Satisfaction can often be enough, but when the intense feelings of winning have become routine, happiness begins to seem flat and mundane. It isn’t sufficient. Calvin and Hobbes captured it well in a strip: “Happiness isn’t good enough for me! I demand euphoria.”

- Now I think that reminiscing about our well-being in the past can obscure the possibilities of the present. As always, a good memory leaves a nice aftertaste, and our brain will try to bury anything that gets in its way. You don’t need to maintain this excitement to pull out all the stops in a race, especially if you know that when you arrive, even after fighting tooth and nail in a world-class competition, at most you’ll have the satisfaction of confirming that you’re still in shape. This is more than enough to give it your all.

- If I had to describe the mountain race I would least like to run, I’m sure I would say that it’s short, without many downhill slopes or long stretches of trail, or that it has a wide dirt road and many kilometers of flat terrain. It would have no rocks on the trail or technical terrain, and would pass by peaks that call out to you to climb them but really are just there for decoration, since you have to run through their foothills without coming close to the highest parts. If any race fits these parameters, it’s Sierre-Zinal. And despite this, I’m crazy about it.

- I guess what excites me about this race is exactly that. It’s run in terrain where I don’t feel comfortable, where I know I have to face my weak spots as a runner and fight those weaknesses in order to win. For me, that’s what gives competition meaning—seeking difficulty and embracing it. And the fact that the route is the opposite of what I prefer is exactly why I approach it as a challenge with all the necessary ingredients to keep me interested.

- Generally, I prefer to be in the second or third row. People start too fast and they often push you, or in ski mountaineering, someone might break your pole by accident or take the skin off one of your skis. Furthermore, in the first row, the runners’ anxiety is more intense. It seems like the activity is more important than it really is, and there’s always some journalist who wants you to grin and pose or say something stupid.

- I start thinking about my brief conversations on the way here. Those people were anonymous and, in a certain sense, slow runners. For me, running is easy, and doing it fast is, too. Winning, on the other hand, is harder and demands many hours of training and effort. But without wanting to seem arrogant, winning has also become relatively easy for me over the years. In the end, I do virtually nothing else all day, and I hardly think about anything else, either. I run and make money. Today I’ve earned a few thousand euros, and thanks to my victories, brands want to sponsor me. That teacher and the guy who works in construction, on the other hand, will never be on the news or sign an autograph. In the end, it’s paradoxical, since the world would work just as well without runners, but without anyone to teach us to write and count, or build the houses we live in, life would truly be difficult. I feel bad about myself. Today I’ve earned money from a useless activity. I’ve monopolized the attention and admiration of children and adults, and all I’ve done is put one foot in front of the other faster than them. I accept that, inwardly, running is everything to me. On the other hand, outwardly I’ve come to terms with the fact that it’s pointless.

- Competitive sport is also overvalued, and increasingly exposes the dark side of human nature. The monetization and mythification of sports have turned it into a classic spectacle, causing it to be simplified, and the results to be organized more hierarchically. In the Olympic model, what matters is your place on the podium, with the winner situated visually above those who come second and third, and all three obscure the existence of the other athletes. People only remember the results and the winners. At the same time, countries exploit their athletes’ success to reinforce nationalist discourse, even those countries that are in decline. Just as in climbing victory is signaled by planting a flag on a mountain’s summit, in world championships or in the Olympic Games, national symbols become propaganda tools.

- For our part, athletes have come to believe that winning makes us better than the person in second place, since everyone applauds and congratulates us. This has allowed us to sign contracts and experience the illusion of relative fame. But in this context, sport loses its essence and enters a different realm, obsessed with winning at all costs. Of course, everyone has their own technique, but it’s clear enough that the temptation to cheat is high. There’s always someone who breaks the rules of the game to increase their chance of victory, which, by definition, is futile. Luckily, the sports I practice still preserve a solid amateur component. They’ve been spared the black mark of the period of doping by big teams or countries, when publicity and reputation were considered much more important than athletic performance.

- When someone gets caught doping, I don’t get mad because I think I should have won. What really bothers me is that their performance isn’t authentic and isn’t a valid reference point, and it sets a bad example for sport in general.

- I DON’T MIND ADMITTING THAT I MAKE QUITE A BIT OF MONEY COMPETING, but I also spend a ton to be able to do so. I was born in Europe, I’ve had the good luck to do this for pleasure, and I’ve never had to see it as a way to make a living, though I’d be lying if I claimed that was never an incentive, especially when I remember that at the beginning of my career I was pretty broke. But I knew deep down that if it didn’t work out I could earn a living somehow or another, or keep studying and take whatever path interested me most. I live in the first world, after all. This is why I’ve always considered myself an amateur. The word is a Gallicism that comes from the Latin amator, meaning “one who loves.” And there’s no doubt that I’m in love with the sports I practice.

- Once I was out of my teens, my need for recognition vanished. I could have stopped competing because I could tell I had an aversion to the podiums, the hierarchy the results imposed, the mythification . . . but when it’s fairly easy for you to win, it’s hard to stop. In all honesty, every victory feeds your euphoria, you feel strong, and you feel loved. If you could choose euphoria, would you be content with just happiness?

- In the end, when I come down from the crest of this wave of feelings, I can see clearly what competition really gives me: it always challenges me, making me doubt my abilities and ask myself what shape I’m in at the time. I never know if I’m training hard enough or slacking off, and when I want to be the best version of myself, I look for and analyze every small detail, to progress and explore my limits. And when I have other famous competitors to contend with, it’s easier to motivate myself to train hard. What really drives me is to try to win races in which the uncertainty of the result is as high as possible.

- Yes, I like winning—there’s no doubt about it—but I also like losing. I like spending time with new runners who are more motivated than me, better trained, and have a stronger desire to reach the top. Competing by their side recharges my batteries, motivates me to learn from and battle it out with them, if I can. Then the competition becomes, in part, a checklist I use to test whether I’m capable of keeping up the level I demand of myself, and whether my training or the changes I introduce get the results I’m hoping for. Apart from all that, does anyone know a better high-intensity training than participating in a world championship, or competing in the UTMB or the Sierre-

- I didn’t choose to be admired. In fact, there are moments when it disgusts me. I’ve never wanted to be a role model to anyone. I’m sorry, it’s just not something I chose. And at the same time, I don’t ever want to have to do or stop doing anything for anyone.

- Little by little, I grew used to people again, and, hiding out in Norway, I recovered my dreams of the mountains. These are the dreams only you yourself can understand, since in them you aren’t looking for difficulty, great heights, or beauty, but rather you’re searching for yourself. Each mountain is the shape of the person who wants to climb it; a solitary ascent isn’t the one you feel with your hands on the rock but the one that beats inside you, while on the outside your body is fighting.

- Chamonix is the only city in the world where you can walk down the street calmly in ski boots and Gore-Tex in the middle of August when it’s thirty degrees Celsius without feeling like an eccentric.

- The first thing you see on arrival when you approach by road is a sign saying CHAMONIX MONT BLANC, with a second line below, LA CAPITALE MONDIALE DE L’ALPINISME (THE WORLD CAPITAL OF MOUNTAINEERING). It is also known by other names, like the one invented by the American climber Mark Twight, who called it “Death Sport Capital of the World.” We could also name it the world capital of ego per square meter, since the city is home—either permanently or for long stretches—to the best specialists of all mountain-related disciplines, from downhill cycling to climbing, not forgetting BASE jumping, parachuting, trail running, ice climbing, extreme skiing, and a long list of etceteras.

- He contemplates everything he does through a satirical lens, and says that his work as a mountain guide is unique since it consists of putting people in danger in order to save them.

- Simón tells me that his book is an “ode to failure,” since “in mountain climbing there are so many heroic tales about epic ascents and life-or-death challenges to reach a summit, but we all know that ninety-nine percent of the time you don’t actually reach the summit. There’s no heroism, because that’s not what mountain climbing is about. It’s bisexual, it’s about optimizing all the resources available, and usually ending up not setting foot on the summit, but that doesn’t mean you’ve failed. Quite the opposite.”

- “What I do is divide the season into stages,” I told him, “but since every year my goals are scheduled around the same time—skiing from January to April, running from May to September—it’s easy to set up a routine. That way I know in advance that fall is when I need to focus on volume, and the beginning of winter I need to work on intensity, and I keep going like that, following the blocks I’ve set up.” “I train in blocks, too,” he explained, “but they’re not fixed by the time of year. Instead, I set them depending on what I’m working toward at the time. For example, if my goal is to go to California and free-climb El Capitán, I do a few specific months of strength training and sport climbing beforehand, with a week of distance training in between, so I don’t lose any muscle mass. If the goal is a huge wall in the Himalayas, I spend a block focusing on resistance training, with a lot of slopes with easy terrain, and a few weeks of technical training mixed in.”

- Once he made it down alive and kicking, a void took hold of his spirit, the kind of void that fills everything when you’re convinced you’ve reached a limit you’ll never be able to surpass. When you’ve experienced that limit.

- Every once in a while this happens: when someone imagines and goes through with something the whole world believes impossible, rather than feeling inspired, many people shut off in denial. It’s easier to say no than to recognize your own limits.

- I learned that simplicity is the hardest thing to learn in this world of inhuman dimensions, since it’s the purest form of commitment and discomfort.

- They taught me that if you want to climb as simply as possible, the way the Jordis recommended, all you really need—to climb any mountain in the world—fits into a forty-liter backpack. I ended up filling that backpack to the brim with other treasures: the silences between the few words they spoke—you could fill an encyclopedia with them—and the idea that less is more, and doing something means nothing, but how you do it means everything.

- I noticed the first symptoms of my abduction when I caught myself uttering the words of the gurus in this sect—words like “We shouldn’t adapt the mountains to our needs but work on our abilities to adapt ourselves to the mountains.” Now that I think of it, maybe going against evolution is the perfect way to evolve.

- When you’re in an uncertain situation, you need to be able to control your emotions, even find a way to eliminate them, and let reason and instinct lead your actions.

- I know perfectly well that many people think the line between total commitment and thoughtlessness is very thin, if indeed they think there is a line at all. The most plausible result of a fall from a great height is death, and any exception would come down to extraordinary luck. But what lies behind an accepted commitment, even in unfamiliar terrain, is the result of a careful study of conditions and painstaking planning, after scrutinizing the difficulties over and over, from the foot of a wall or from other peaks.

- The perception of risk is a personal matter. While it’s true that it depends on an equation involving individual ability and experience, and the conditions and difficulties of the mountain in question, committing to a climb is always a personal choice.

- We live in a world of parallel realities that observe but choose not to understand each other. When we get up in the morning and browse the news or check Twitter, we get the false impression that we are everywhere. We see images of a terrorist attack in Baghdad, a protest in Murcia, or a migrant boat that’s just sunk off the coast of Greece . . . and since we are all parents, children, or immigrants, we identify with what’s going on. A few seconds later, we read a comment by a politician out of context, and we either applaud or get mad. Then a viral video grabs our attention, and we laugh our heads off at something dumb. And then . . . and then . . . Everything seems close. We

- For a few years now in our society, our materialistic focus on personal image has become as important as our capitalist, materialistic focus on well-being. Until recently, the cultivation of a personal image was limited to politicians and pop stars, but today, nobody is immune. It all began when they started trying to put us at the center of everything, with the typical entrepreneurial slogans, like “You are your own brand!” It continued with companies choosing potential employees based on their social-networking profiles. Or with tech multinationals deciding whether we were better or worse, authentic and unique or a waste of space, according to how many comments or likes we received. Or with our loss of privacy, when it became possible for anyone who cared to find out what you ate, what music you listened to, where you bought your socks, who you admired, and where you were thinking of going on your next vacation. We’ve become obsessed, and now we’re like putty, working away at trying to fit into a mold. We have ended up turning into—they have turned us into—a tiny piece of the commercial world.

- The sports we are sold today are a spectacle, and a spectacle needs an audience. And the audiences are no longer in the stadiums. Or, to put it another way: yes, they are—they’re in the one massive stadium the world has become. Everyone has a preferred seat, in their home. An athlete is an athlete twenty-four hours a day and, on top of training, he has to live “authentically” and have a “take” on everything. And since he’s no longer just talking to four freaks who understand him—the audience is no longer a minority but global—everything he says must be straightforward and simplified, to quickly catch the attention of a public that consumes information at the speed of a machine gun firing a round of bullets. I know I have five or six seconds to produce a spectacular image that will leave you, the spectator, breathless, and grab your attention because it’s interesting and not just entertaining. There’s no need for complicated explanations and “insignificant” details, since those can get a little too interesting. You have to go straight for an easy headline, for a number that’s easy to understand and compare, for competition between news items, athletes, people.
