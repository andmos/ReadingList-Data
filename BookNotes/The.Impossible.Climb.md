### Highlights

- But Alex wasn’t thinking any of this. He had trained himself not to let his mind wander when he was on the rock. He was famous, after all, for his ability to put fear in a box and set it on an out-of-the-way shelf in the back of his mind. The life questions, the analyses—he saved that stuff for when he was hanging out in his van, hiking, or riding his bike. At that moment, he was just having fun and not thinking about anything except climbing and climbing well.

- Freerider is so named because it’s a “free” climb, which means it can be ascended with nothing more than your hands and feet, the rope acting only as a safety net, in case you slip off. The very best climbers can scale Freerider without aid, but I couldn’t think of a single person who hadn’t fallen at least once on the way up.

- What it all came down to was that for Alex Honnold, a life lived less than fully is a fate worse than dying young.

- But although Alex was a confirmed geek, people still respected him, says Ben, because he was so intelligent. He was a top student in the school’s International Baccalaureate program, despite having no real passion for academics. He did the bare minimum to get by. Alex’s mom was a member of Mensa, a society for people with high IQs. Alex also took their test and passed. According to Mensa, his intelligence puts him in at least the top two percent of the general population.

- Smalley visited Alex that winter and grew concerned about the way his friend was handling the death of his father, which was to act as though nothing had happened. “I remember explicitly asking him, ‘Why aren’t you grieving more?’” says Smalley. Alex explained it away, telling Smalley, “Dad and I weren’t super close. All he really did was take me climbing—it’s all we shared. We didn’t talk. He just sort of ghosted through the house. It’s hard to miss someone who wasn’t really there.” When Smalley pressed, explaining to Alex that it was important for his emotional health to go through the grieving process, Alex replied, “You don’t understand. Your family is normal and wholesome, and my family is weird and fucked up.” Alex would later tell me that his dad’s death had been somewhat surreal. One day, he came home and found his mom sitting on the edge of their pool with her legs dangling in the water. She was crying. “Your dad died,” she said.

- In the aftermath of his father’s passing, Alex became, in his words, “a born-again atheist.” Dierdre had been raised Catholic and had taken Alex and Stasia to mass a few times, but Alex knew that neither of his parents believed in God, and neither did he. Years later, when I asked him about his spirituality, he said, “All this talk about intelligent design—‘Like, wow, look how incredibly well designed the eyeball is’—that’s all bullshit. I’m totally happy ascribing it all to chance. You just need enough bits and random events and eventually crazy things happen.”

- That winter, when he wasn’t getting lost in video-game fantasy worlds, Alex thought about what might constitute a good life. It all boiled down to a few simple facts. He did not believe in an afterlife, which meant the most precious commodity he possessed was time. So how to spend his capital? Climbing was the one thing in his life that lit his fire. Nothing else inspired him, no other interests, not friends or girls, certainly not school. Climbing allowed him to get lost in the joy of the moment. And he was good at it. When he climbed, people noticed him.

- He was still climbing indoors on plywood walls covered in textured paint, a medium as far removed from the real world as the landscapes of Azeroth.

- JOHN BACHAR GREW UP A few miles from Los Angeles International Airport in Westchester, California, in the 1960s and early ’70s. He was a precocious boy who excelled in both academics and sports. In high school he played baseball and tennis and was an all-conference pole-vaulter. Bachar dreamed of being an Olympian and trained for a few years under Joe Douglas, whose Santa Monica Track Club would go on to produce world record holders like Carl Lewis. But Bachar soon became disillusioned with the rigid structure of traditional sports, and while casting about for something new into which he could pour himself, he found his way to the graffiti-covered boulders at Stoney Point, a small climbing area in the hills north of Hollywood. On these rocks, Bachar, having no idea what he was doing, tested himself on the same short but strenuous boulder problems that iconic climbers like Royal Robbins and Yvon Chouinard had used as their training ground back in the 1950s and early ’60s.

- “Want to try something a bit bigger?” asked Long, pointing toward the route called Double Cross. Long was proposing “bouldering” a full-pitch rock climb or, in other words, free soloing it (a pitch is the distance one can climb in a single rope length; in the 1970s, most ropes were 150 feet long; today, 200 to 230 feet is standard). “No way,” said Bachar, who had never climbed more than a few body lengths above the ground without a rope. “That’s crazy.” “If you climbed this route a hundred times, how many times would you fall?” countered Long. Bachar thought about it for a bit and then replied, “None.” The climb, which turned out to be well within Bachar’s comfort zone, was a revelation. Without the encumbrance of ropes and hardware, the feeling that Bachar got on Double Cross was better than doing drugs. He would later say that Long’s question that day changed his life and that afterward, “there was just this weird twitch inside of me.”

- One of the first things a new climber learns is the numerical system used to grade the difficulty of routes. There are several different systems in use throughout the world. The American version is called the Yosemite Decimal System (YDS). It categorizes terrain into five classes. The encyclopedia of all things climbing, a book called Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills, breaks the classes down as follows: Class 1: A hiking scramble to a rocky gradient; generally hands are not needed. Class 2: Involves some scrambling and likely use of hands; all but the most inexperienced and clumsy will not want a rope. Class 3: Moderate exposure may be present; simple climbing or scrambling with frequent use of hands. A rope should be available. Class 4: Intermediate climbing is involved and most climbers want a rope because of exposure. A fall could be serious or fatal. Class 5: Climbing involves use of a rope and natural or artificial protection (anchors in the rock) by the leader to protect against a serious fall. The five before the decimal point of a rock-climbing technical difficulty grade simply denotes that it is fifth-class, that is, roped climbing. In the 1950s, when the Sierra Club first developed the system, fifth class was originally envisioned as including ten subgrades from 0 to 9, denoted as 5.0, 5.1, 5.2, and so on. The 5.0 grade was assigned to the easiest fifth-class climb, and 5.9 given to the hardest, which at the time was a route at Tahquitz in Southern California called Open Book. However, it quickly became apparent that a closed-ended system was not going to work because soon someone did a climb harder than Open Book, and then another climber bested that effort. So the system was revised and made open-ended. Then climbers began parsing the higher subgrades into easy, medium, and hard. So, for instance, 5.10 had three additional subdivisions: 5.10–, 5.10, and 5.10+. Eventually the pluses and minuses gave way to four increments of a, b, c, and d. Thus, 5.11a is only one tick harder than 5.10d and three ticks, or letter grades, less difficult than 5.11d. (In some cases, climbers have sliced it even thinner, e.g., 5.11b/c.)

- Climbing grades are inherently subjective. A tall person might be able to reach past a featureless section to a beefy handhold, where a shorter climber might have to make creative use of faint ripples in the rock while stabbing desperately for the same hold. But over time, a consensus develops around a particular climb’s difficulty, and the system is remarkably consistent from one climbing area to the next.

- Currently, the hardest sport climb in the world is a route called Silence in the Hanshelleren Cave in Flatanger, Norway. The climb was first envisioned and bolted by Adam Ondra in 2012, but it wasn’t until 2016 that he began projecting the route in earnest. The bolts are spaced a body length or two apart, which means he’d fall anywhere from ten to thirty feet when the climb spat him off—something that happened hundreds of times. He finally found success, after some fifty days of working the route, in September of 2017. Ondra has tentatively rated the climb 9c, a French grade, which translates to 5.15d on the YDS.

- But while all of Yosemite’s notable cliffs had already been scaled, these ascents were accomplished with the use of aid, meaning the climbers placed anchors—pitons, mostly—into cracks in the rock and hung from them in slings while hammering in the next steel wedge a few feet higher. For Bachar and the Stonemasters, the new game was to climb free, that is, without pulling on gear, resting on the rope, or standing in stirrups. Ropes and hardware were still used for protecting the climber against a fall, as a safety net, but never for upward progress. Every move had to be accomplished with the hands and feet alone.

- Warren Harding, who first climbed El Capitan over a span of two seasons, during which time he left his ropes “fixed” on the wall, had more in common with a skyscraper construction worker riveting I beams together than with this new breed of gymnast, who saw climbing as pure athleticism.

- To Bachar and the other Stonemasters, smooth and cool meant moving fast, carrying a small rack of protection, and placing pieces far apart—“running it out,” as climbers like to say. It was a form of self-expression demonstrating both the inner calm of a Zen master and the tenacity of a martial artist. And indeed, Bachar kept a picture of Bruce Lee, in mid-punch, taped to a page in his climbing journal.

- But the Stonemasters weren’t the first to climb rocks without a rope. Modern free-solo rock climbing can trace its roots back more than a century to an Austrian alpinist named Paul Preuss. In the early 1900s, Preuss authored more than three hundred first ascents—half of which he did solo. He disdained the use of equipment like pitons and even ropes because to his mind, they tainted the essence of alpinism, which was to climb mountains without the use of mechanical aids. But his boldness eventually proved his undoing. On October 3, 1913, while attempting a solo first ascent of the North Ridge of the Mandlkogel in the Austrian Alps, Preuss fell to his death. He was twenty-seven years old.

- The term “on-sight” had been adopted from the French climbing term à vue, which means a route is climbed with no prior knowledge other than its rating. In its most perfect sense, the climber doesn’t even see the route until the moment he arrives to attempt it.

- Three hundred feet above the ground, he found himself barely holding on in a slippery open book, the crease in the back too thin for his fingers to fit inside. Fully committed, unable to reverse the moves he had already made, Bachar punched through. Afterward, as he hiked down the back, he felt hollow. “I’d gotten away with something,” he later told a friend. “I hadn’t conquered anything. The mountain had just let me off.”

- In Europe, the birthplace of climbing, a new style was coming into vogue. Rather than go from the ground up, French, Spanish, and Italian climbers were rappelling from above and bolting routes with power drills. Where a hand-drilled bolt might take half an hour to place, a power drill could do the job in seconds. This new practice came to be known as “rap bolting.” Once the bolts were in situ, the first ascensionist would “work” the route by climbing from bolt to bolt, resting on the rope along the way. When they had the climb fully memorized and rehearsed, an attempt would be made to climb the whole thing in one go without falling. If successful, the climber would say he had “redpointed” the route. The term comes from the German word Rotpunkt, which means “point of red.” It was coined by Kurt Albert in the 1970s after he began painting a red dot at the base of routes in the Frankenjura that he had free climbed. This new style was called sport climbing, and it was much safer than traditional climbing. Sport climbing soon became the world standard, and by utilizing these modern tactics, grades broke the 5.14 mark for the first time in the late 1980s. But Bachar would have none of it. He called its practitioners “hang dogs” and famously stated around this time that climbing without risk isn’t really climbing.

- “Soloing goes with being a total loser,” he later told his friend Chris Weidner. “You show up at a crag with no friends and you do your thing.”

- Things sometimes got weird when he ran into other people. A part of him wanted to show off, but only if the climbing was well within his comfort zone. If the climbing was hard, near the limit of what he was capable of on-sight free soloing, which at the time was 5.10c or so, he couldn’t have spectators. One day he was climbing such a route, which featured a short roof that was high enough off the deck for a fall to be fatal. His hands were jammed into a crack above the overhang, and as he was screwing up his nerve to commit to the move, he looked down and saw two tourists staring up at him. Alex froze, then retreated to a comfortable stance. He would wait until they left. But the tourists lingered, and Alex found himself wondering whether they were judging him, if they thought he was a coward for his obvious trepidation. Finally they left, and Alex pulled the roof. Later, reflecting on the incident in an essay published in Rock and Ice magazine, he wrote: “After that, soloing became even more solitary for me because I feared doing something stupid when people were watching. Yet it was still a difficult balance, since there are always people at climbing areas, and I often just wanted to climb. And honestly, sometimes it was nice to impress people. But pride is dangerous since it leads to recklessness or overconfidence, which have no place in soloing.”

- Alex’s obsession at the time was to tick off as many routes as he could. His goal was twenty-five pitches a day, which he would compulsively record in his black book every night in his tent. He was on-sighting these routes, then downclimbing them, which, according to his rules, allowed him to count each route twice. He stuck with this program day in and day out in order to climb, as he later put it, “crappy little faces with no appeal besides the tick I could put in my guidebook.”

- In August, they celebrated Alex’s twenty-first birthday at a bar in Squamish, British Columbia. Some local guides bought Alex a drink called a muff diver—a shot of Kahlúa with a cherry floating in it, buried under whipped cream. Alex declined, telling the small crowd that had gathered around to watch that he didn’t drink. The Canadian guides wouldn’t hear of it. Of course he would dive the muff. How could you not? For Christ’s sakes, it’s your twenty-first birthday, they cajoled. They got borderline aggressive. It got awkward. But Alex stuck to his guns.

- What was Alex like back in those days, before he became famous? I asked her. “He was an asshole,” she says. “All he cared about was climbing. He was obsessed. You don’t do the stuff he does and come down and be normal. It’s a package deal.”

- Before the tourist hotels and the guided nature walks led by the famous naturalist John Muir in the 1870s, Yosemite Valley was home to a polyglot tribe of Native Americans (mostly Miwoks, Paiutes, and Monos) who called the place Ahwahnee (which means “Gaping Mouth”) and themselves Ahwahneechee (“those who live in the Gaping Mouth”). The troubles began when a carpenter named James W. Marshall found flakes of gold in the American River in 1848. This discovery set off the California gold rush, which drove tens of thousands of fortune hunters into the Sierra Nevada. Conflicts between the prospectors and the indigenous tribes who lived in these mountains soon followed.

- His book recounts the effort he made to record the names the Ahwahneechee had ascribed to virtually every feature in the valley. Then, without apology, Bunnell renames everything. The valley’s biggest cliff seems to have more than one native name. Tul-tuk-a-nú-la is a Miwok word meaning “Measuring Worm.” The name comes from a creation story about El Capitan. Two bear cubs, their bellies full of berries, fall asleep on a rock, which grows up underneath them into a towering cliff. All the animals in the valley try to climb the wall to save them, but they find it impossible. Finally, an inchworm, the least likely of all the valley’s creatures, offers to help. Inch by inch, it scales the wall and saves the bear cubs.

- The other native name for El Capitan is To-to-kon-oo-lah, which means “Rock Chief.” Bunnell writes that when he asked Tenaya about the origin of the name, the chief took him to an overlook with a view of the cliff and “triumphantly pointed to the perfect image of a man’s head and face, with side whiskers, and with an expression of the sturdy English type.” Translating Tenaya’s “Tote-ack-ah-noo-la” into Spanish, Bunnell named the wall El Capitan. Most important, he also named the valley itself (with input from the other soldiers), “Yosemity.” The name probably comes from the Miwok word yohhe’meti, which, according to Bunnell’s book, means “grizzly bear.” It was the name other tribes called the Ahwahneechee because of their renown as hunters of these bears.

- What the soldiers did to the Ahwahneechee is the part that’s been edited out of the story at the visitor center’s replica Native American village. Apparently, the park service has decided that people would rather not know that the US government–sanctioned Mariposa Battalion torched the Ahwahneechee’s villages, looted their food stores, and killed Tenaya’s favorite son in cold blood—then brought the great chief to see the body. “In no fewer than seven separate incidents [in Yosemite Valley] they killed at least twenty-four to thirty Ahwahnees, and perhaps many more,” says Benjamin Madley, a historian at UCLA and the author of An American Genocide. This number was a fraction of the total number of Native Americans killed during the six-month campaign. The battalion, which would be well paid for its service, disbanded on July 1, 1851. In the end, it succeeded in driving the Ahwahneechee out of their ancestral home to a reservation on the Fresno River, where they would face death and starvation.

- By the 1950s, the park service decided that the Ahwahneechee Village was an eyesore and a new rule was established, whereby only employees of the park service and its concessionaire would be allowed to live in the park. The last dwelling was destroyed in 1969. Today, in addition to the faux village at the visitor center, a project is under way to rebuild one of the original Ahwahneechee villages, called Wahhoga, on its former site. It currently has on display a few conical bark dwellings called umachas.

- Ammon McNeely, “the El Cap Pirate,” held the record for the most different routes on El Capitan (sixty-one). He was so fond of malt liquor he attached beer koozies, like gun holsters, to the sides of his harness so he could fortify himself with liquid courage while leading hard aid routes. Once, while rope soloing a route called Eagles Way, he took a huge fall and ended up hanging unconscious, covered in blood, on the end of his rope. Yosemite Search and Rescue (YOSAR) soon arrived at the base of the cliff with a bullhorn. “Do you need a rescue?” they yelled up the wall. The loudspeaker woke McNeely from his drunken, concussed stupor. He sat up, looked around, and then yelled, “Fuck you,” so loudly that supposedly people in Camp 4, two miles upvalley, heard his answer. Then he climbed back up the rope and kept going.

- To be a Stone Monkey was indeed to stay stoned much if not most of your waking moments. There was, after all, no other way to claim legitimate lineage to the original Stonemasters—the crew that famously set themselves up with a lifetime supply of pot in 1977. In January of that year, word trickled into Camp 4 that a plane filled with 6,000 pounds of red-haired sensimilla had crashed into a remote lake in the Yosemite backcountry. The DEA knew about the wreck but was able to remove only a small amount of the contraband before getting shut down by a blizzard. Luckily for the Stonemasters, the DEA decided to leave the plane and finish the job in the spring. Several of the Stonemasters, including Bachar, hoofed it more than ten miles through the snow to the crash site, where a hobo camp had formed in the woods on the edge of the lake. The scene was a veritable melee, with drug-crazed climbers hacking and sawing through the ice and sometimes fighting over the bales of weed that littered the lake. Bachar chopped a hole through the ice and snagged a forty-pound bale printed with a pot leaf, which he later sold in allotments as small as a quarter ounce. With the 8,000 dollars he netted, he bought a 1968 Volkswagen bus. Rumor has it that nearly a ton of weed was procured from “Dope Lake” before the rangers finally figured out that their little secret was known by virtually every climber in California.

- As an accomplished BASE jumper, Potter took to sometimes free soloing with a parachute, a sport entirely of his own invention, which he called freeBASE. This allowed him to push his free soloing out to the edge of his climbing ability. His most notable freeBASE took place in 2008, when he climbed the 1,000-foot-long 5.12+ Deep Blue Sea on the north face of the Eiger (13,025 feet elevation) in Switzerland.

- As a speed climber, free soloist, highliner, and wingsuit BASE jumper, Potter was without peer. He rampaged around the world practicing what he called his “arts,” perhaps in acknowledgment of the Wizard moniker. By the mid-2000s, he was one of the most recognized and respected outdoor athletes in the world. He and his wife, Steph Davis, a top female climber, were the power couple of climbing. Thanks to lucrative contracts with companies like Patagonia and Black Diamond, they made a nice living and owned homes in Yosemite and Moab.

- Unlike so many other sports, climbing has no arena; there are no grandstands at the base of the cliff. Nor is there a scoreboard or official results. If a climber wants his exploits known, he or his partner often just has to tell someone. Climbers call it “spraying,” and for really good climbers, the ones with sponsorships and endorsement contracts, it’s generally seen as a necessary evil. And yet there’s no getting around the unseemly fact that it’s bragging, and every climber knows it in his heart. Consequently, many climbers struggle to affect a low-key demeanor while letting it slip that they just did such and such hard route and the crux was wet and they were already tired from doing such and such other hard route.

- Gym climbing had been exploding in popularity. With tens of thousands of young kids getting into the sport, it was inevitable that the overall level of climbing would rise accordingly. In the 1990s, there were only a handful of people capable of climbing the rarefied grade of 5.14. Ten years later, you could go to the local gym in any big city and probably find young kids climbing that hard.

- The Monkeys had seen the kid around; a few had spoken to him and climbed with him. But he was standoffish, which rubbed some people the wrong way. Rumor also had it that he drove his white Ford E-150, which someone had nicknamed the “Pedophile Van,” down Highway 140 every night to a pullout just outside the park boundary. The Monkeys took pride in their outlaw status, sleeping illegally under boulders, on ledges at the base of El Capitan, or in their vehicles in unoccupied campsites. But this Honnold kid actually followed the rules. Who does that? wondered Cedar.

- JUST LIKE IN HIGH SCHOOL, Alex made no effort to try to fit in with the eclectic posse of misfits who called themselves the Stone Monkeys. Cedar, who soon became a close friend of Alex’s, says that Alex thought the whole Stone Monkey scene—the pot smoking, the drinking, the ape calls, the ridiculous singing and strumming around the campfire at night—was “stupid.”

- The new kid had some similarities to Peter Croft. When Croft made his first road trip to the valley from his home in British Columbia in the late 1970s, “he was like Huckleberry Finn or the Jungle Boy,” said Jo Whitford, Croft’s first wife, in an article in Climbing magazine. “He wore these old corduroy shorts, all jagged, that he’d cut off with a Swiss Army knife. He’d go out soloing all day, come down and hang out by himself, and sleep in the dirt. He didn’t even own a sleeping bag.” Her husband, she said, had a hard time interacting with people he didn’t know well. “He thinks about things. He likes to find out about the truth.” Young Alex was seeking his own truth.

- He had planned to rest for one day and then go for it, but it rained, and you can’t climb on sandstone when it’s wet because the holds absorb water and become extra friable. Climbers in sandstone areas like Zion and Red Rocks go ballistic if you break this taboo and climb when the rock is wet, because you could break a key hold and destroy a route. In Alex’s case, the consequences were a bit more severe.

- But he also thought about how things could go wrong and what it would feel like if he slipped. Rather than hide from this reality, he explored it, right down to picturing how it would feel to hit the ground at terminal velocity. In his mind’s eye, he hovered above his crumpled, bloody body. It was all part of his preparation. He wanted to think about it now, thoroughly, so he didn’t have to when he was up on the wall. Get it out of his system, so to speak. This way there wouldn’t be any surprises.

- The average climbing party takes two days to climb Moonlight Buttress, sleeping in a portaledge on the side of the cliff halfway up, hauling bags full of provisions, and aid climbing most of the route. Alex topped out eighty-three minutes after he had set off from the base with a few songs left on his playlist. On the descent down the back, Alex joined a popular trail leading to the summit of Angels Landing, where he passed dozens of tourists. His climbing shoes were too tight for hiking, so he carried them in his hand. A few people felt the need to let Alex know how foolish he was for hiking barefoot. Alex just smiled and chuckled to himself.

- He weighted his right toe and bore down as hard as he could on his fingertips, still making sure not to put weight on the carabiner. The foot held, and he snatched for an in-cut edge with his left hand. Done. He charged up the final crack leading to the summit and, as he topped out, passed about twenty people sitting on the edge of the cliff. He half expected—hoped—that someone would yell, “Holy shit, everybody, check it out, this madman just free soloed the Northwest Face of Half Dome.” But no one said a word. A couple sat on a ledge a few feet away making out. The girl was cute. She paid Alex no mind. He might as well have been invisible. Shirtless, panting, he looked at his chalk-covered hands and wrists and the veins bulging from his forearms. He looked around again. It was a beautiful sunny day; a hundred tourists were spread out across the summit of the dome, reveling in the views of the surrounding Sierra Nevada and congratulating themselves on the strenuous ten-mile hike to the summit of such a remarkable geologic formation. No one noticed him. Not one single person.

- ALEX LOWE WAS A MAN custom-built for such superhuman feats. His upper body was triangular, bulging arms hanging from broad shoulders tapering down to a narrow waist. His outsize, scar-covered hands often sported “gobies” and “flappers,” climber-speak for the cuts and flaps of skin you get from stuffing your paws into rough-sided cracks. His barrel chest housed a set of lungs that could have sped him through the Tour de France had he chosen to ride bikes instead of climb mountains. In 1993, he was invited by the Russian Mountaineering Federation to take part in a kamikaze-style climbing competition on a 23,000-foot peak in Central Asia called Khan Tengri. The field included many of the best mountaineers in Russia. Alex didn’t just win; he crushed the previous best time by more than four hours—a record that still stands today.

- By 1996 the North Face had grown into the world’s largest outdoor clothing and equipment company. Doug and Susie Tompkins had launched the North Face brand thirty years before on October 26, 1966. (The Grateful Dead played at their grand opening, and the Hells Angels worked the door. Rumor has it that Electric Kool-Aid was served.) Within two years of founding the North Face, the Tompkinses sold their interest in the company for 50,000 dollars. It was then bought and sold a dozen times before it was acquired by an investment group in 1994 for 62 million dollars. It fell to the new CEO, Bill Simon, to prep the North Face to go public, and he had a radical idea. Typically, when a clothing company needed photos for an ad campaign, it hired models, went somewhere scenic, and did a photo shoot. Instead Simon used a substantial portion of the company’s marketing budget to fund a team of professional climbers and skiers. He recruited a dozen of the world’s leading rock climbers, alpinists, and extreme skiers, including Alex Lowe. Greg Child, an Australian expat who climbed the North Ridge of K2 in 1990, was offered a contract worth 75,000 dollars a year, plus benefits and stock options. “For the first time in my life, I had a real salary, and my job description was to climb my ass off and travel the world putting up first ascents,” says Greg. The North Face had just made professional climbing a plausible career—one that allowed this handful of “athletes” (a then novel term for people living on the fringes of respectability) to earn a decent living. Almost immediately after its inception, Simon sent the Dream Team—Lowe, Child, Californians Conrad Anker and Lynn Hill, plus a handful of others—accompanied by outdoor photographer Chris Noble, on expedition to an alpine version of Yosemite Valley in Kyrgyzstan called the Aksu.

- When I got home, I went golfing with my dad. After seventy days in the Arctic, the grass was greener, the buzz of the crickets more all encompassing, the sky a deeper shade of blue than I remembered it. When my dad swung his three wood I’d swear I saw tracers as his club whooshed through the air. I felt like I was high, but I wasn’t on drugs. After some introspection, I realized the strange sensation I was experiencing was from being in the “now,” something I had only previously experienced while climbing or skiing powder. After living in the moment for thirty-nine days on the side of an Arctic big wall, I found I could enter the now when I was strolling down a fairway or looking out the window at a birch tree swaying in the breeze. That’s what cemented it, when I knew I had found my calling, the reason I was alive—to seek out and climb the great big walls of the world, wherever they might be.

- By the time jared left New Hampshire, I realized I had learned something from him that would forever change the way I climbed. Skillwise, I wasn’t that far behind him, yet he was climbing at an elite level, and I wasn’t. Why? I had just spent several days witnessing exactly what made him so great: the heart he put into his climbing. Climbing with Jared made it painfully obvious that I wasn’t trying my absolute hardest—not even close. Spanish climbers have a saying for the way Jared climbed—a muerte—to the death. It doesn’t mean you’re trying to kill yourself, but rather that you’re going at the climb with a grittiness and determination that leaves everything you’ve got on the cliff. The caveat was that you could flick this switch only when you were ready, when you understood your limits instinctively and knew right where that imaginary line is that you can’t cross. Flick the switch before you’re ready, and you might well be going to your death. Jared showed me that it was time for me to flick it and that I was ready. And that all I had to do was decide I wanted it that badly.

- The expedition cook, Gulam Rasoul, once told Greg Child that the name Trango probably comes from the Balti word tengo, which means “hair-oil bottle.” There are two bottles that rise from a ridge between the Trango and Dunge Glaciers. The more northerly tower is called Nameless, a flawless obelisk of granite whose summit is guarded on every aspect by sheer 3,000-foot walls. Its neighbor, Great Trango, is one of the largest pieces of exposed granite in the world, a complex massif of gullies, hanging glaciers, and soaring rock faces. The 5,000-foot pillar on its east face was first climbed by Norwegians in 1984. High on the wall, the team of four realized they didn’t have enough food, so two of them rappelled down. Five days later, they saw their companions top out the wall and reach the east summit. But on the descent, something went wrong and the pair disappeared. Their bodies were later spotted at the base of the wall, before being buried in an avalanche.

- Everest may be the tallest mountain in the world, the crown jewel of the Himalaya, but any serious mountaineer will tell you that it’s not the world’s ultimate peak. That distinction has always belonged to the world’s second highest, K2, aka the “Savage Mountain.” The rather unimaginative name derives from the mid-nineteenth-century Survey of India, during which the six highest points visible from Mount Haramukh in Kashmir were named K1 through K6. The K, of course, stands for Karakoram, a Turkic name for the black gravel that covers many of the dry glaciers in this region. As of 2016, only three hundred or so people have stood on K2’s summit, while around 5,000 have climbed Everest. Even the easiest route to K2’s summit, the Abruzzi Ridge, is far steeper and more technical than Everest’s standard South Col route. The summit of K2 is the most elusive, dangerous, and hard-to-reach place on earth. For every four people who stand on top, one dies trying to get there.

- When viewed on a map, the three-hundred-mile-long, east-west-oriented Karakoram appears to be the northwestern extension of the Himalaya, but it’s technically its own distinct range, separated from the Himalaya by a fifty-mile-wide plain bisected by the Indus River. Both mountain ranges were formed by the collision of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates, but the Karakoram was formed more recently and has grown more quickly, and this has resulted in its mountains being more heavily glaciated and densely packed. In the center of the range lies an area informally known as the “third pole,” an ice cap that holds the planet’s largest reserve of freshwater outside the polar regions. One of the glaciers that spokes off the third pole is the Siachen, which runs for more than forty miles down the center of a disputed area over which both Pakistan and India have claimed sovereignty since the mid-1980s. Hundreds of troops are stationed along the disputed border at heavily fortified high-altitude camps. Every year more of the troops die from exposure to the Karakoram’s harsh weather than from combat.

- Shortly after arriving in base camp, I awoke in the middle of the night to a roar that sounded like a 747 taking off nearby. Seconds later, a hurricane-strength blast of wind flattened my tent, pressing me facedown into my sleeping pad. I knew it was an avalanche, and that if I stayed where I was, I’d be buried alive. So I desperately fought my way out of the flapping nylon. Outside, I watched the brightly lit Quokka communications tent go fully airborne, with Brito riding it like a magic carpet. When it was five feet off the ground, the lights went out. Screams filled the air. Whoever it was, I couldn’t tell, must have thought he was about to die. The rushing air was laden with slush, which shellacked me from head to toe. I couldn’t see anything and there was nowhere to run, so I crawled back into my tent and huddled in the fetal position. A minute later, an eerie silence fell over camp. The debris—television, refrigerator, and car-size chunks of ice that had peeled off a hanging glacier—had stopped five hundred yards short of camp. Trango was saying hello.

- Our plan was to climb the wall in capsule style, meaning we would fix ropes and then use them to rappel back down at the end of the day. The next day we would climb back up the ropes to our high point with mechanical ascenders and foot loops—a process we call “jugging.” At the high point we’d pull more ropes out of our packs and then lead higher, laying more lines behind us as we went. Eventually the commute would become so long that we’d set a camp, pull the ropes up from behind us, and use them to restart the same process.

- In 1953, news of Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay’s first ascent of Everest was sent via a runner from base camp, who took four days to reach the nearest telephone. Thirty years later, high-altitude filmmaker David Breashears broadcast the first live TV images from Everest’s summit. Now, at the dawn of Y2K, there we were documenting an entire two-month-long expedition in close-to-real time.

- House’s article was espousing a modern evolution of the alpine-style climbing that the legendary Tyrolean mountaineer Reinhold Messner first brought to the Himalaya in the 1970s. The ethic of alpine style is that you start at the base of the mountain with your pack, climb as high as you can each day, find a bivouac, and then continue on in like fashion until you reach the top. Messner and his partner Peter Habeler were the first to climb Everest without supplemental oxygen, in 1978. Beforehand, Messner had famously said that he would climb Everest by “fair means” or not at all. In his landmark 1971 essay, “The Murder of the Impossible,” Messner decried the growing trend of climbers using oxygen and excessive amounts of equipment to bring down a mountain’s difficulty, rather than rising to meet the peak on its own terms. He wrote, “Today’s climber doesn’t want to cut himself off from the possibility of retreat: he carries his courage in his rucksack.”

- Before Messner arrived on the scene, Himalayan peaks were usually climbed in “expedition style.” The idea is simple: You lay the entire mountain, from top to bottom, with ropes. It’s a laborious way to climb a mountain, but it’s relatively safe and the nylon umbilical cord offers a fast and efficient way to get off the mountain if someone gets hurt or sick or bad weather comes in. The problem comes once the climbers have made the summit. At this point, all they want to do is get down safely, and as a result, it’s common for the fixed lines to be left behind. By the time the next season rolls around, the ropes are often unusable, shredded from the wind or frozen into the slope, which means a new set must be laid. On popular 8,000-meter-peak trade routes like the Abruzzi Ridge on K2, there are so many old ropes in place that it’s virtually impossible to climb the mountain without stumbling over them. If you’re like Messner or House, and you want to climb these routes in their natural state, you’re out of luck. Expedition style is how most of the 8,000-meter peaks were first climbed, and for the most part, it’s how they are still climbed today. If you sign on with a commercial expedition, even to smaller mountains like Nepal’s Ama Dablam, you pay for the privilege of using the umbilical cord, which is typically set by local high-altitude Sherpas or porters. You show up, attach your ascenders to the rope, and up you go.

- Climbers have been arguing about style since Edward Whymper first climbed the Matterhorn in 1865. While there have never been official rules that dictate how a mountain should be climbed, there have always been various unwritten ethical codes. On Great Trango, we knew we were violating some of those codes—using too many fixed ropes and bolts, “spraying” about ourselves on the Internet, and posing for the cameras—but the compromises seemed unavoidable if we were going to document the climb in the way we had promised our sponsors. We found ourselves in the same position Ron Kauk did when John Bachar flattened his bolts ten years earlier. Only now it was our reputations being flattened.

- According to Twight, this passage spoke to what his team was seeking. “We were on Denali to prove the existence of consciousness,” he wrote. “I’ve tried to explain the crack we peeped through, but even close friends can’t understand. What truth we learned is locked in our three hearts alone.” This ultraminimalist style became known as “light and fast” alpinism. Now even carrying bivouac gear was seen as a devolution of the sport. Some called it “disaster-style,” on account of how little room for error you had when climbing the world’s biggest alpine faces with little more than the clothes on your back. Either way, most climbers thought it was an unrealistic ideal: There were only a handful of alpinists in the world who had the skill and desire to climb abiding by this new ethos. And as Twight had just unapologetically made clear, everyone else had no business on the mountain.

- Through the peephole I saw Alex Honnold standing in the hallway wearing nothing but a pair of boxer shorts. I invited him in, and he took a seat on the bed. It was the first time I’d sat face-to-face and talked with the guy, and I was immediately captivated by his eyes, which were deer-in-the-headlights huge. “Vodka?” I offered, holding up the bottle. “I don’t drink,” he said. “Never have. I don’t smoke or use caffeine either.” So that’s why the Brits had nicknamed him “the Monk,” I thought to myself. But then he qualified his teetotaling with an awkward admission: “Actually, I do have one vice—fornication.” “What did you bring to read?” I asked, having long since learned you could never have too much reading material on a climbing trip. “I brought five books,” he replied. “And I’m glad I did because I’ve already read two.” Alex rattled off some titles that included The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoyevsky and several philosophical treatises on atheism.

- I had always put climbers in one of two categories: those who’d had the wake-up call, and those who hadn’t. Until a climber has experienced a serious accident, it’s easy to feel invincible, to fall into the trap of thinking Bad things happen, just not to me. Conrad, having lost several of his best friends to climbing accidents, and having nearly died himself on Shishapangma with Alex Lowe and Dave Bridges, certainly had his eyes wide-open. But what about Honnold? His eyes appeared to be wide-open, but were they really? Did he recognize how close he was to the edge?

- BEFORE I LANDED IN KOTA KINABALU, or KK as the locals call it, my idea of Borneo was pretty much the common caricature: a primitive jungle island crawling with hungry cannibals with bones stuck through their noses. KK, I discovered, is a thriving first-world metropolis that serves as a popular vacation destination for Asians, especially Japanese. Ringed with tropical beaches, KK, which is home to about 450,000 people, reminded me of Honolulu. What I didn’t know is that Borneo, the world’s third-largest island, is divided among three different countries. Three-quarters of the island is Indonesian territory, while the northern portion is mostly part of Malaysia, except for a 2,200-square-mile enclave on the north coast owned by the tiny nation of Brunei.

- One day when he was six, Jimmy came home from tae kwon do practice after a snowstorm. His father, Frank, was waiting for him at the end of their long driveway, which was covered in a foot of snow. “He didn’t say anything and just handed me the shovel,” says Jimmy. “He trained me by crushing me.”

- According to Grace, the mantra in the Chin household was “Push harder; accomplish more,” to become better than everyone else so you could be a doctor, a lawyer, or a CEO. “Dad’s philosophy was that whatever you did, it wasn’t good enough,” says Grace. “Because obviously you could try harder and do even better.”

- At Carleton College, Jimmy majored in international relations. In a comparative religions seminar, he was introduced to the Tao Te Ching and the I Ching, the ancient Chinese divination texts that form the religious and philosophical basis for Taoism. “These books spoke to me,” says Jimmy, “probably because of the Confucianism I learned as a youth in Taiwan. Taoism taught me to focus on the process, and not to be attached to preconceived ideas of what I thought the outcome should be.”

- I kept sniffing for the park’s most famous plant—Rafflesia arnoldii, aka the “stinking corpse lily.” It’s the word’s largest flower, and its petals can grow to more than a meter in diameter. Its smell, as one might guess, is said to be nauseating.

- Drilling a bolt is the one way in which climbers permanently alter the landscape. Once that four-inch-deep hole has been bored into the rock, it will be there forever. For this reason, many climbers, myself included, try to avoid using bolts, if at all possible. I had to weigh the question of whether I was “murdering the impossible” against the chance that I would fall, pull out all my protection, and break my legs when I hit the ledge where Alex was holding my rope. Picturing myself crumpled and broken was all the convincing I needed.

- I assumed Alex had always been a nitpicker, but his friend Chris Weidner later told me that Alex’s attitude began to change in 2009. Weidner first met Alex in 2006, before he was famous, and he says that in those early days, Alex was soft-spoken, thoughtful, and generous to a fault. When they climbed a route called Golden Gate on El Capitan in 2007, Alex practically dragged Weidner up the wall. “He was a really, really supportive partner, even though, compared to him, I sucked.” But over the next few years, as Alex’s fame grew and he became a public figure, Weidner says he also became more self-centered. “I don’t know whether he was getting a little older and more comfortable in his skin, or what,” recounts Weidner, “but he definitely changed a bit, and I wasn’t too psyched about it.” According to Weidner, Alex couldn’t understand why his friend wasn’t as motivated or as strong as he was, or why he didn’t see things the same way he did. He was showing zero empathy and being selfish “in the way that a psychopath is selfish,” says Weidner. “It was insane how obsessive and nitpicky he was: ‘Why do you need to drink that cup of coffee, why are you drinking that wine, why do you put so much salt on your dinner?’” It got so bad that Weidner stopped using salt because it was easier than battling Alex about it.

- “Hey, Alex, what are you going to call your pitch?” asked Conrad, who was drawing a map of our route, what climbers call a topo, in a small yellow notebook. On a big-wall first ascent, it’s a custom to give names to significant pitches or features. “I hadn’t even thought about it,” replied Alex, “but how about ‘the Emily pitch—beautiful and intimidating.’” “Emily” was Emily Harrington, a twenty-two-year-old whom Conrad had recently signed to the North Face team. She was around Alex’s age and one of the best female climbers in the world. She was also spunky and quite attractive. Alex had a huge crush on her. He knew that in the small world of the climbing community, word gets around, and she’d eventually hear about the “Emily pitch” (she did). I never would have had the gumption to do something like that when I was Alex’s age.

- Later, as the three of us settled in for the night, Alex grew quiet and I figured he had fallen asleep. I’d noticed in base camp that he usually went to bed right when it got dark. He was one of those guys who just had to close his eyes and he fell asleep and snoozed right through until morning. “You know, I’m kind of feeling like a pansy,” announced Alex, out of the blue. “How so?” I responded. “You just did the sickest lead I’ve ever seen.” “I know,” he replied, “but it scared me. I shouldn’t have gotten so scared.”

- Climbers, always concerned about weight, don’t usually bring books up on the mountain. Back in 2002, on a ski mountaineering expedition with Warren Miller Entertainment, I had gotten trapped for three days in a blizzard high on Mount Waddington in the Coast Range of British Columbia. To keep ourselves from losing our minds, my partner “Sick Rick” Armstrong and I had devised a game: We took turns making up stories about the cute little bear with the red Santa’s cap on our Sleepytime tea bags. We played for hours at a time, each picking up where the other had left off and working hard to outdo the other guy by having the bear do completely outrageous, illegal, and immoral acts, which will remain between Rick and me. Stuck in storms at various bivouacs over the years I’ve told endless stories—some of them completely made up. I’ve read the directions on hot chocolate packs like they were New Yorker articles. Once, in Pakistan, I built a maze on the floor of my tent for an old tired fly I coaxed along by prodding him with a piton.

- THE SUMMIT, which we reached three days later, was beautiful but anticlimactic, as they always seem to be. We work so hard and take so many risks on these climbs that I suppose it’s inevitable that mountaintops hardly ever live up to the monumental billing we attach to them. The letdown is so common that some climbers have said that summits don’t matter. It’s a gallant idea, but if the summit doesn’t matter, where exactly are we heading when we set off from the base?

- Alex Honnold had reminded me of the old climbing proverb: “There are old climbers and there are bold climbers, but there are no old bold climbers.”

- Climbing became my passion, and the strength of that passion gave my life the orientation and purpose it had previously lacked. Climbing taught me what the fox meant when he told the Little Prince, “One sees clearly only with the heart. Anything essential is invisible to the eyes.”

- Alex’s smugness, his condescension, the way he would look at you while you were cutting him down to size and just smile—it was lovable. You knew he was thinking, Dude, don’t you realize what a fucking badass I am? Do you realize how foolish you sound, trying to tell me what’s what? In most people, this attitude would be insufferable, but in Alex it was somehow endearing, probably because he could actually back it up. Compared to the false modesty so common in climbing, his brashness was refreshing. He wore his ego right on his shirtsleeve like the logo of one of his sponsors.

- FreeBASE wasn’t quite free soloing, because he would be wearing a BASE-jumping rig, which meant that a slip didn’t necessarily mean certain death. But it wasn’t BASE jumping either, because the exit—if it occurred—was not a controlled event. If he slipped or popped off unexpectedly, there would be no horizontal vector to his launch; plummeting only inches from a cold wall of rock, he’d somehow need to find a way to orient himself in the air in order to track away from the cliff.

- TWO WEEKS LATER, Dean tried again, and this time he succeeded in making the world’s first ever freeBase climb. And Jim filmed it. The footage ended up in the Sender Films Reel Rock Tour. At the end of the segment Dean says, “The thing I’m getting out of pushing my limits is that I turn impossible to possible. . . . The possibilities of what we’re capable of doing if we believe in it is the most compelling thing I can think of.”

- A few weeks later, Alex and I left for a sailing and climbing expedition to the Musandam Peninsula in Oman, where a magical fjord land on the southern shore of the Strait of Hormuz dazzled us. For three weeks, we explored the area’s vast climbing potential—we found hundreds of miles of untouched cliffs lining the shore. We also learned about the Kumzari people, who live in remote fishing villages that can be accessed only by boat. The Kumzaris are a network of families with their own pidgin dialect, a legacy of the cultural collision that has been going on there since ancient times. Linguists don’t know how their language developed, but it mingles Farsi, Arabic, Hindi, Portuguese, French, Italian, Spanish, even English. One theory is that the Kumzaris were originally nomads from the mainland who were pushed out onto the tip of the peninsula by Arab, Yemeni, and Portuguese invaders. Another, more intriguing theory (which I made up) is that their ancestors include shipwrecked sailors who washed ashore, perhaps as long ago as the Middle Ages.

- What they didn’t publicize was the fact that Alex personally seeded the foundation with 50,000 dollars (about a third of his income that year)—the money his financial adviser had recommended he invest in a mutual fund. “Alex is not the most emotionally expressive person,” says Birdwell. “But he still feels the connection just as strongly as everyone else. He’s the kind of person who expresses himself through his actions.”

- It didn’t take long for Alex to realize that the place where the Honnold Foundation could have its biggest impact was in rural Africa, where many people still didn’t have access to electricity. More specifically, Alex was interested in pay-as-you-go solar systems. Hesser, who had been working in the industry for ten years, had already concluded that this very specific slice of the clean energy market was exactly the place where there was the most potential for creating transformative change. He hadn’t held Alex’s hand; he just sent him the reports, and Alex had figured it out all on his own. “Intellectually, logically, he pieced it together really quickly,” says Hesser. “It was really impressive.”

- The Honnold Foundation’s first project took place in the Kayenta region of the Navajo lands in Arizona, where Alex, Maury, and Cedar Wright worked with a partner called Elephant Energy to install solar panels on homes that had been waiting for years to be connected to the electrical grid. More projects followed, including an expedition to Angola that combined a solar project with the chance to climb first ascents in a largely unexplored mountain range. But Alex wasn’t using his star power to pump up the volume on the Honnold Foundation. He was giving away a substantial portion of his personal wealth, and doing so in a meticulously premeditated way, but without any fanfare or hoopla. Birdwell says that the reason Alex has been low-key about his foundation is that he doesn’t want to brag about what he’s done so far, because the scale, at least to date, has been too small. “He’s trying to hit a really long ball,” is how Hesser puts it.

- “Alex has a really interesting relationship with money,” says Hesser. “Giving away 30 to 40 percent of his income [each year] doesn’t mean the same thing to him as it might to someone else. Alex doesn’t worry about money the way most people do. It’s part of his character, and it’s part of what makes him so unique and special.” Hesser left me with a story about the time Alex gave a talk in San Francisco to a bunch of well-to-do professionals. Afterward, Alex was musing about how differently he views risk than the people in the audience. “Sure, they could lose all the money in their hedge fund one day,” said Alex, “but they still go home and sleep in a nice bed at night. It’s not like they die.”

- The van careered around a bend on Highway 120, its tires squealing. Alex wasn’t giving the road his full attention. He rarely did. Alex hates driving. “It’s a waste of life,” he once told me. Driving had always been a time to get things done, to catch up on his correspondence. Sometimes, on roads straighter than this one, he’d read long-form New Yorker articles.

- Alex had planned to ascend fixed ropes with Fitz securely strapped to his back in a child carrier. What could possibly go wrong? The problem was that Patagonia, Tommy’s main sponsor, had caught wind of the plan, and the corporate honchos weren’t into it. What irritated Alex was the fact that people were being irrational and illogical, worrying about what-ifs that were statistically negligible. Sitting in the passenger seat was Joe Hooper, a journalist from Men’s Journal magazine. Hooper was planning to accompany Alex to the summit. When Alex hung up the call, he turned to Hooper and said, “That’s like typical PR shit, and it’s so annoying. That’s why she [the woman in Patagonia’s marketing department] works in an office. The rest of us don’t work in an office because we actually do things.” He paused for a few moments, then added, “I fucking hate PR people.”

- The occasional patch of ice hid in the shadows, but the air was mild, the sky clear. Climbers were calling it “Juneuary.”

- Alex stood in the background quietly observing. Up until this moment, he had been the most famous climber in the world. But not anymore. That title now belonged to Tommy Caldwell. News of the intrepid climbers battling their way up the world’s most difficult rock climb had gone viral shortly after they set off in late December. With access to a strong LTE signal, Tommy and Kevin had been using their smartphones to post daily updates to their Instagram and Facebook accounts from the portaledge at night. It was like reality TV, but you could comment and interact with the stars of the show. If you were lucky, they might even respond.

- At the time of the Quokka experiment on Great Trango, we had no idea how profoundly the rise of the Internet and social media would change the culture of climbing. By 2015, it wasn’t just possible for professional climbers to keep their fans apprised of their exploits in real time; it was expected. Endorsement contracts often included stipulations about social media: how often to post, which hashtags to use, and even creative guidelines. For better or worse, social media was now the primary way climbers interacted with one another and it was how we broadcasted our accomplishments. And it was a rare soul who avoided getting sucked into the vortex.

- Robbins was a serious man, a Berkeley intellectual who carried around leather-bound notebooks to record ideas stirred by the heady books he always seemed to be reading. He kept his hair in a military-style crew cut, was usually clean-shaven, and wore tortoise-shell eyeglasses. He was tall and powerful, with an athletic build and a commanding, almost imperious presence. A gifted free climber, he established the country’s first 5.9-rated route in 1952—Open Book—at a crag called Tahquitz in Southern California, when he was only seventeen. Robbins was a purist. For him it was not about getting to the top of the mountain; it was about the style in which he got there. He espoused a minimalist ethic: a climber should leave as small a footprint as possible. It was a standard to which he held not only himself and his partners but all climbers. At the time he came of age, cracks were being permanently scarred through the use of pitons, which chewed away holes in the rock as they were repeatedly hammered in and out. Climbing needed rules if the cliffs were to be preserved for future generations, and as the sport’s leading light, Robbins felt it was his obligation to make sure people knew what those rules were.

- For Harding, climbing was anarchy. Anyone who didn’t like the way he did things could go to hell. He called Robbins and his followers the “Valley Christians.” And to counterbalance their virtuosity, he founded the Lower Sierra Eating, Drinking, and Farcing Society (LSED&FS), which was dedicated to gluttony and sloth. Their motto was “Semper Farcisimus.” I once attended one of their parties—a celebration of Batso’s seventieth birthday—which took place at a remote, obscure climbing area on the east side of the Sierra. I remember Warren, with stains of red wine all down his white T-shirt, staggering toward his tent shortly after dark. Later that night, after his cronies warned us several times to quiet down so they could sleep, they attacked us. One of my friends got beaten up by an old guy with a shovel.

- It’s good to have a man around who doesn’t give a damn what the establishment thinks...

- John Branch of the New York Times got the first interview with Tommy and Kevin when they topped out. Jorgeson gave him the best quote when he said, “I think everyone has their own secret Dawn Wall to complete one day, and maybe they can put this project in their own context.” He was echoing the same sentiment expressed by Maurice Herzog in the mountaineering classic Annapurna: “There are other Annapurnas in the lives of men.”

- The best climbers, the ones who truly stand out from the rest, the characters who have gone down in history, they’ve all had at least one superlative climb that defined them, a route that redrew the boundaries of human potential, setting a benchmark for the next generation. Even if Tommy and Kevin never climbed another significant route, they could coast on this one for the rest of their lives. Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay had the first ascent of Everest. Reinhold Messner was the first to climb to the top of the world without supplemental oxygen. Harding claimed both the Nose and the Wall of Early Morning Light. Lynn Hill free climbed the Nose in one day. But Alex didn’t yet have the one singular accomplishment that defined him, at least not to his own mind. Free soloing Robbins’ route on the Northwest Face of Half Dome couldn’t be the end, because there was one more obvious step to take. And Alex knew there was only one person who had any business even contemplating that next step. What no one knew, not even his closest friends, was that Alex was already well into the process of free soloing El Capitan.

- Alex had worked on the University Wall for several days prepping it for the solo, but he couldn’t get it dialed to the point where he felt good about it. He would later tell me that he got it to about 95 percent. He had always felt that on a solo he should feel at least 99 percent certain of the outcome, and hopefully with a few .9s tacked on. So he set it aside and moved on to other things.

- What made Reardon’s climb downright mind-boggling was that he claimed to have done it on-sight. Climbing records and the sport’s accepted history have always relied on an honor system. When climbers claim to have done routes, they are taken at their word. But there have been a few notorious characters who famously dishonored the tradition. First there was Frederick Cook, who claimed the first ascent of Denali in 1906. The photo he supplied of his teammate planting a flag on the summit turned out to have been taken on an insignificant subpeak located many miles from the mountain. And there was Cesare Maestri, the Italian who still claims to have made the first ascent of Patagonia’s Cerro Torre in 1959, a climb so far ahead of its time that it wasn’t repeated until 2012. According to Maestri’s account, his partner Toni Egger died on the descent when he was swept off the mountain by icefall, taking the camera and photographic proof of the ascent with him. Maestri claimed that anyone who repeated the route would find his bolts high on the wall, but when the north face of Cerro Torre was finally scaled by an elite team of modern climbers, they found no bolts and the route didn’t match Maestri’s description. When Reardon claimed his free solo of Romantic Warrior—by far the boldest ropeless climb to date—doubts began to surface almost immediately.

- BY 2015, Dean Potter wasn’t climbing much any more. Instead, he spent his time making illegal wingsuit jumps from various formations in Yosemite Valley. He had jumped from every major cliff in the park. Many of his launch points were firsts, and he was constantly on the lookout for new ones. Half Dome was a perennial favorite. He would hike up to the slabby west side of the dome via a secret trail with his dog, Whisper. At the base of the wall, he would put the dog, a blue heeler, into a pack and then free solo a 2,000-foot 5.7 called Snake Dike with the dog—and his BASE rig—on his back. At the top, he’d strap motorcycle goggles over Whisper’s eyes and make sure she was securely fastened to his back, and then the two of them would jump off the Diving Board.

- There were some who argued that Dean’s risk-taking was immoral, but the way Alex saw it, these people were hypocrites because many of them risked their own lives on a daily basis by sitting on the couch eating potato chips. “I was 19 when my father died from a heart attack,” wrote Alex. “He was a 55-year-old college professor and had led what was by all appearances a risk-free life. But he was overweight, and heart disease runs in our family. No matter the risks we take, we always consider the end to be too soon, even though in life more than anything else quality should be more important than quantity.”

- Alex had been asked many times whether he’s a sociopath or if he has Asperger’s, and he has conceded that he’s probably “somewhere on the autism spectrum.”

- I wondered whether this fascination with Alex’s brain reveals more about us, the people asking questions, than about him. Because for every individual who tips his or her hat to Alex’s talent and nerve, there is another, like the Grosvenor Auditorium neuroscientist, who feels compelled to label him as abnormal—and perhaps pathologically so. “People want to explain him away, they want it to be something that doesn’t place a demand on them,” says J. B. MacKinnon, a writer from Canada who arranged the brain scan and later wrote a widely read article about the results for Nautilus magazine. “Because if Alex is just an ordinary guy who managed to transform himself into this superhuman figure of fearlessness and cool under pressure, then they should be able to do that too. And nobody wants to believe that’s the reality. We all feel this need to make him into something different and unique so the rest of us don’t have to take any lessons from what he’s done.”

- The amygdala was located near the bottom of Alex’s brain, not far from the roof of his mouth, and it had not yet come into focus. Like most brain structures, there are two amygdalae, a right and a left. The ancient Greeks were the first to discover the amygdala when dissecting brains, and the name comes from the Greek word for “almond.”

- Joseph started the second part of the test, which she calls the Reward Task. It was a game in which Alex could earn small amounts of money depending on how quickly he pressed the button on a clicker he held in his hand. While Alex clicked away, Joseph monitored a part of the brain called the nucleus accumbens. It’s a structure near the top of the brain stem that processes dopamine, a neurotransmitter that carries electrical impulses between neurons. Most people think of dopamine as the chemical associated with lust, motivation, and addiction, but its function is complex and still not fully understood. What brain researchers do know is that the test Alex was undergoing is known to flood the nucleus accumbens with dopamine in reward-driven people.

- Joseph gave Alex a personality test. Not surprisingly, he scored as twice as likely to seek high sensations compared to the average person. Yet the test also showed him to be well adjusted emotionally. He scored extremely high in the categories of conscientiousness and premeditation, low in neuroticism. But there was one outlier. Joseph had assumed Alex would score low on disinhibition, a term used in psychology to describe the tendency to be impulsive and unaware or uncaring of social customs. A disinhibited person is also likely to be bad at assessing risk. Joseph had assumed that Alex was not overly disinhibited, because if he were, he would have already killed himself free soloing. But Alex had scored high in this category. I wasn’t surprised, however, knowing what I do about climbing. I see it the opposite way: An inhibited person would never get into free soloing in the first place. But what I find interesting is that while Alex scored high in disinhibition, the test also indicated that he’s highly analytical and punctilious—an unusual combination, according to Joseph. This juxtaposition may point to the tension that I have long sensed in Alex, something MacKinnon also noticed. He described Alex to me as someone who is “constantly suppressing some kind of internal intensity.”

- THOSE OF US WHO KNOW and follow Alex weren’t surprised when we heard the results of the scan. Over the past twenty years, he has focused intently on learning to control fear. It’s been a gradual process, something he once described to me as “slowly expanding the bubble around my comfort zone.” It’s a progression every climber must follow, from first overcoming the irrational fear that ropes and anchors won’t hold, on up to learning how to stay calm and loose when executing difficult moves, even if the fall would be dangerous.

- When Alex’s book came out in the fall of 2015, I interviewed him for National Geographic. He told me that one of his prime motivators for writing it was to help people understand why he can do what he does: “I’ve done so much soloing, and worked on my climbing skills so much that my comfort zone is quite large. So these things that I’m doing that look pretty outrageous, to me they seem normal.” He said that it makes “total sense” to him and that it’s “easily understandable,” but still, people don’t seem to get it. “Maybe I should have explained it better,” he said.

- The rationalization that his free soloing is no more dangerous than being a cabbie in a busy city is one that Alex has carefully constructed, probably because it’s the keystone in the philosophical edifice he has built to justify the risks he takes. Try to tell him that free soloing is dangerous, and he will argue the point, every time.

- According to the Insurance Information Institute, the lifetime odds of dying in a car accident for a person born in 2013 are roughly one in six hundred. Change the metric to dying in any kind of accident and the odds are one in twenty-four.

- our one-in-twenty-four chance of dying in some kind of accident the same way Alex looks at free soloing. We choose to go through life believing that we won’t be unlucky because otherwise, we’d be too afraid to get in our cars or even leave the house. If hanging from a fingertip jammed in a crack 1,000 feet off the ground is just as ordinary an experience for Alex as negotiating rush-hour traffic is for the rest of us, then one might have to admit that his rationalization makes sense.

- Alex tries to deal with fear in the same way he would other basic emotions, like hunger. “When you’re hungry, you set the feeling aside and eat when it’s convenient,” says Alex. “With fear, your pulse quickens, your vision narrows, and you’re like, ‘Oh my god, I’m feeling fear, oh my god, oh my god,’ and then it cascades out of control and you lose your ability to perform. With free soloing, obviously I know that I’m in danger, and feeling fearful while I’m up there is not helping me in any way. It’s only hindering my performance, so I just set it aside and leave it be.”

- And LeDoux dismisses the possibility that Alex’s amygdala is dormant. Instead he posits that Alex may have been born with a muted amygdala response relative to the general population, making him a genetic outlier, so to speak. He also says it’s likely that Alex has desensitized his amygdala to be less responsive to threats, particularly those associated with heights, by routinely exposing himself to high places. “By self-exposing, training himself in those situations, he’s going to reduce the amygdala activity, because that’s what exposure does. And perhaps he has trained himself to be able to turn on that inhibition when he goes into those kinds of situations.”

- Whether you are fearful of heights, financial problems, or your spouse being unfaithful, Nik said it’s our choice whether we want to “allow it to take root.” He compared fear to a weed in your garden. If you don’t pull out the weed, it spreads and takes over. “As soon as I experience any thought of fear, I kick it out immediately. I counter it with, ‘No. I know what I’m doing. I’ve done this my whole life. I’ve trained for the worst cases.’ I always counter negative with positive in every aspect of my life. I truly have no question in my mind that fear is a choice.”

- Said, like all of the three hundred or so inhabitants of Taghia, is a Berber. The name Berber is a derivation of “barbarian,” from the Greek word barbaros. Berbers have lived in northern Africa for thousands of years, and they are well-known as traders who braved the Sahara to establish caravan routes connecting sub-Saharan Africa to the Iberian Peninsula and beyond. One of those routes, reported to have been in continuous use for at least seven hundred years, passes directly through Taghia Gorge via the same path I’d followed from Aguddim to Said’s gîte.

- I had never met Sanni (short for Cassandra), and the only thing I had heard about her was that she had “dropped” Alex while climbing at a cliff called Index in Washington State. I learned the details, like most of the climbing community, in a publication called Accidents in North American Mountaineering. As the title suggests, it makes for grim reading.

- (toproping is when the rope is run through an anchor at the top of a route and the belayer is situated at the base of the climb; it’s the way most ropes are set at indoor climbing gyms).

- Alex wasn’t taking any responsibility for the accident. As the vastly more experienced climber, it was his job to “close the system” before leaving the ground. The standard way to do this is to tie a barrel knot in the end of the rope. If he had done that, the knot would have jammed against Sanni’s belay plate when he ran out of rope, preventing it from popping through. Sanni had been climbing for only about six months and had barely climbed outdoors, so it was unfair to put the blame on her for a housekeeping safety detail. Alex, the same guy who showed up to climb a choss big wall in Borneo without a helmet, has always been resistant to the sport’s long-established safety protocols. Perhaps when you free solo big walls, tying knots in the end of the rope seems a bit silly.

- “When I first was living in the van and road-tripping, my first interview in Rock and Ice I was like, ‘Oh, I’m in the magazines, and now I’m gonna get laid.’ But it did not work at all. It’s surprising how, even after being in a bunch of films and being on the cover of things, it turns out that personality is more important. So, it’s still not really working, but thanks for rubbing it in.”

- At the anchor of the sixth pitch, about halfway up, I met Alex, who was on his way down. He had climbed the entire route in about ninety minutes. “What are you doing?” he said. “I’m working my way up,” I replied. “What does it look like I’m doing?” For a brief moment, I thought Alex was about to give me some kudos for making it as far as I did. “This is like when they let a normal guy into the pool in the Olympics,” said Alex. All I could do was laugh. “You really can be a dick sometimes,” I replied. “I thought I was doing well.” “Well, for a middle-aged father of four, you’re doing great.”

- Said appeared with a second tagine, this one meat-free for Alex, who has been a vegetarian since 2012.

- The kitten must have smelled the tagine. It darted in the door, wove its way between our legs, and jumped up onto the couch with Alex. Someone mentioned how the creature looked well. It had been so scrawny and emaciated when the crew first arrived that people weren’t sure it was going to make it. Said had been putting out bowls of milk, and the crew had been slipping it plenty of snacks. Alex then casually said he wouldn’t care if someone killed it. All eyes in the room turned on him: eyebrows raised, looks of bemusement, and grumbles of disapproval. Having known Alex for eight years, I’ve heard this sort of comment before. You might even call it a signature Alexism: first, that it occurred to him to contemplate whether he cared at all about the cat, second, that he decided he didn’t, and third, that instead of keeping his mouth shut, he decided to share this gem of a revelation with the rest of us.

- Alex told me that he had just been e-mailing with some folks from his high school in Sacramento. They were inducting him into their Hall of Fame at a ceremony in October, and they had a few questions, like how did his education at Mira Loma High prepare him for the things he’s doing now. “So?” I asked. “I just told them that I never really gave a shit about my education, but that school did help shape my overall worldview.”

- Afterward, when I talked with Mikey about the experience of filming Alex free soloing, he described some of the thoughts running through his mind. “He’s running at low rpms, barely revving his engine, but still, I feel like I’m watching someone on top of a building who’s about to jump. And it’s sucking the energy right out of me. This must be like war photography. The chance of someone dying—it’s not a point-zero-zero sort of thing; it’s a percentage point, like multiple points. It could happen. I wouldn’t want to do this job every single day for a year. Oh man, that would be really bad odds.”

- Any climber who ventures out of the gym or beyond manicured sport-climbing crags has had close encounters with rockfall. It’s part of the game and a risk you learn to mitigate rather than eliminate.

- In Jimmy’s film Meru, he has a line about how the best alpinists are the ones with the worst memories. Only those who can selectively forget the misery and near misses are willing to return again and again to attempt big, dangerous climbs.

- The Signal and the Noise is all about statistical probability and why most predictions fail. In the book, Silver explains what he calls the prediction paradox: “The more humility we have about our ability to make predictions, the more successful we can be in planning for the future.” I found it interesting that the world’s greatest free soloist was reading a book about probability in the weeks leading up to what could be called the ultimate gamble. I wondered where Alex put his odds of success if he decided to go for it.

- Alex said that while training in Switzerland that past summer, he had visited his friend Ueli Steck, a brilliant forty-year-old climber nicknamed “the Swiss Machine.” Steck is a household name in Europe, known for constantly breaking his own speed records on classic routes in the Alps, like the North Face of the Eiger. Steck is to alpine climbing and mountaineering what Alex is to rock climbing. They had gone on a hike in the hills above Steck’s home and talked about “when you just take the chance.” Steck told Alex that on some of his big climbs, he “seizes his moment and just goes for it,” acknowledging that when the stakes are high enough, he’s willing to roll the dice. Steck was undoubtedly referring to his 2013 solo ascent of the 8,000-foot South Face of Annapurna, a 26,545-foot mountain in Nepal. This climb is high on the short list of the boldest Himalayan coups in the history of the sport. Annapurna, the tenth-highest mountain in the world, is often called the “deadly mountain.” As of 2012, 191 people had stood on Annapurna’s summit, and 61 had died trying to get there or on their way back down—a fatality rate of roughly 32 percent, the highest of any 8,000-meter peak.

- There had been several times over the years, since I had first gotten to know Alex, that I wanted to grab him, shake him by the shoulders, and say, “Dude, if you don’t step back from the edge, you’re gonna miss out on a lot of good living.” I felt that same impulse on the rooftop in Taghia. Instead, I said, “There’s a lot of things that you still need to experience, Alex.” “Yeah,” he replied, looking mischievous and not missing a beat, “like threesomes.”

- Alex took Tommy’s tiny hand—about the size of one segment on Alex’s index finger—and gave it a shake. “Nice to meet you, Thomas,” he said, looking our little man in the eyes with a bemused smile. “Welcome to my home,” he said proudly, gesturing toward the interior of his Dodge Ram ProMaster 2500. He had traded in his old van, a smaller Ford Econoline, after nine years and 190,000 miles. A futon set on a wooden frame about three feet above the carpeted floor took up the rear. Underneath was a storage area where he kept his climbing gear in crates. Above the bed sat a bookshelf, about two-thirds full. It was dark back there and I couldn’t quite make out the titles, but I recognized several guidebooks to Yosemite and the Sierras, and I supposed the rest were probably environmental nonfiction, the subject he was currently most passionate about. Across from the door, a countertop ran from the edge of the bed to the back of the driver’s seat. It housed a propane range with a double-burner stove top and a small oven below. “My friends convinced me I should have an oven,” he explained, “but I don’t know. I’m not much of a baker.” A small sink without a faucet was adjacent to the stove, beneath which sat a minifridge. Cabinets made of some kind of blond hardwood, perhaps maple, hung above and below the countertop. The handles were different-colored lobes from Black Diamond Camalots—a type of camming device.

- In my years of climbing and hanging out with Alex Honnold, I’ve learned that when he mentions he might do something, he’s already made up his mind he is doing it. And, of course, then he does do it. At times like this, I could still get caught off guard and find myself sitting there, my jaw on the proverbial floor, stupefied at the audacity this guy could wear so comfortably, like one of his well-loved red T-shirts. Evidently the injury had done nothing to disturb his confidence.

- He reached for a journal with a black cover sitting on the counter and jotted down some symbols to denote the set he had just cranked off. He explained that he has different symbols for the various holds on the board. I looked over his shoulder as he flipped through a few pages. The book was filled with what looked like hieroglyphics. For years, Alex has been recording everything he does related to climbing, every route, how long it took, little notes on how it felt, plus the details of every training session, including every hangboard set. “I’ve got stacks of these notebooks at home,” he told us, “going back to around 2004.” “Is it actually useful to record all that info?” I asked. “Believe it or not, I do look back on it occasionally, and I can see how much I’m improving—or not.” He put down the book, opened the minifridge, and pulled out some hummus and a loaf of bread. “And I’ve been making progress. Earlier in the summer I couldn’t even hang the half-pad edge, but now I can.”

- There are two things Alex trains to improve his prowess on the rock—power and endurance. The latter is something that he has in almost unlimited supply, and he maintains it by running, going on long hikes, and soloing and simul-climbing a mind-numbing number of pitches every week. He once free soloed one hundred pitches in a morning—that’s more than the average weekend warrior climbs in a year. His legendary endurance is a big part of what sets him apart from other climbers. And it’s what has allowed him to climb things like the Yosemite and Taghia Triple Crowns. Tommy Caldwell is the only climber I know who can keep up with him in the endurance arena.

- The difference between sport climbing and the big-wall linkups that Alex specializes in is like the difference between sprinting and distance running. One relies primarily on power, the other on endurance. Alex is a long-distance thoroughbred, not a sprinter, and no matter how hard he trains, he will never be able to pull as hard as the world’s best sport climbers, guys like Chris Sharma, Adam Ondra, and Alex Megos; just like how Haile Gebrselassie will never beat Usain Bolt in the hundred-meter dash—and Bolt will never beat Gebrselassie in the 10,000 meters. The point is that while sport climbing and big walls are part of the same sport, they’re entirely different disciplines. One of the things that makes climbing unique, though, is that the different disciplines can be combined.

- Since I first met Alex, he has always been quick to point out climbers who can crank harder than him: “You know Alex Megos did Realization in one afternoon, right? That’s just sick.” (Realization is widely regarded as the world’s first 5.15a, established by Chris Sharma in 2001.) It bothers Alex that he’s lauded as one of the world’s best rock climbers, when there are teenagers popping up in climbing gyms all over the country who can pull harder than he can. Earlier in the year he recounted a story of getting burned off by a fourteen-year-old girl at an indoor climbing center in Denver: “I was like, wow, I can’t climb that route. I wish I could climb as hard as that little girl.” He routinely gets questions about whether he will compete in the first Olympic climbing competition, which will take place in Tokyo in 2020. “People don’t get it,” he said. “I just can’t perform at that level.”

- I passed him little Tommy, and Alex plopped him into his lap. After a few minutes, Tommy, who had recently learned to sit up, began leaning forward, which turned into a slow-motion fall. There was plenty of time for Alex to grab him, and Hampton and I both assumed that’s what would happen. But for some reason, Alex just sat there. Tommy toppled out of his lap and bonked his head on the corner of the doorframe. It was one of those wipeouts where the baby doesn’t cry at first, making you think, Maybe it wasn’t as bad as it looked—then he explodes like a volcano. Tommy’s ear-splitting wails soon filled the van. Hampton scooped him up and gave me an annoyed look that said, What the fuck is up with your friend? “Wow, I just crippled little Tommy,” said Alex with a sheepish look on his face. “Sorry about that. I guess I’m not cut out to be a father.”

- East-west is an ideal orientation for a rock-climbing venue, because it means that the cliffs lining the valley, for the most part, face north or south. Having both sunny and shady offerings makes it possible to rock climb year-round in Yosemite—yet another reason it’s the world’s climbing mecca. Climbers always prefer to be a little cool rather than a little warm, because chilled rock offers excellent friction, whereas hot rock does not.

- The conversation turned to Adam Ondra. The day before, as a warm-up for the Dawn Wall, he had attempted to free climb the Nose, the same route Warren Harding pioneered up El Cap back in 1957. It remains the cliff’s most popular route, and for most climbers it’s the most accessible way to scale El Cap using a combination of aid-and free-climbing tactics. Five years after El Cap was first free climbed via the Salathé Wall by Todd Skinner and Paul Piana in 1988, the Nose still eluded climbers seeking an all-free ascent.

- In 1986, Hill finished second to Destivelle in the famed Arco Rock Master competition. In an interview with Rock and Ice magazine in 1992, Hill tells of the time she asked one of the Rock Master officials why there was such a disparity in prize money between the men and women. His response: “If the women climb without their tops, then we’ll pay them the same.”

- TOMMY MAY BE THE ONLY person who can keep up with Alex in the mountains, but there’s one thing he won’t do: climb without a rope. From an early age, his father drilled into him the family ethic of avoiding needlessly reckless pursuits. And by needlessly reckless he meant two specific types of climbing: Himalayan alpinism and free soloing.

- In 2014, while descending from a marathon linkup of seven peaks on Patagonia’s Fitzroy massif, Tommy and Alex were discussing a familiar topic among all climbers: Were the risks worth the reward? Tommy told Alex that his risk calculus had changed since he became a father—he’d become more conservative as a climber. Alex replied bluntly that Tommy’s family “would be fine without him.” Tommy wasn’t offended; Alex has no children, and he comes from a family that supposedly never used the “L word.” Tommy understood the remark as perhaps reflecting Alex’s own view of himself, that he wouldn’t be unduly missed if he died soloing.

- Peter Croft once explained the feeling you get from free soloing as a heightened type of perception. A little edge that you need to stand on looks huge—everything comes into high relief. That’s just what happens to your body and your mind when you’re focused intensely on the feedback you’re getting from the environment and there are no other distractions. You become an instinctive animal rather than a person trying to do a hard climb, and that perception doesn’t immediately go away when you get to the top. It dulls over time, but for a while it feels like you almost have super senses. Everything is more intense—the sounds of the swifts flying around or the colors of the sun going down. A lot of times I don’t want to go down, I don’t want it to end.

- Maybe we’re all guilty of ruthlessly overanalyzing Alex’s motivations—like we do our own. Perhaps Alex is simply trying to “live deep and suck out all the marrow of life,” as Henry David Thoreau wrote in Walden. Sebastian Junger, in his book War, which chronicles the fifteen months he spent embedded with a platoon in Afghanistan’s Korengal Valley, explained it like this: For a nineteen-year-old at the working end of a .50 cal during a firefight that everyone comes out of okay, war is life multiplied by some number that no one has ever heard of. In some ways twenty minutes of combat is more life than you could scrape together in a lifetime of doing something else.

- My peak as a climber had come and gone. As I dangled on the rope contemplating the trajectory of my own climbing career—it all went way faster than I could have imagined—I remembered a conversation I’d recently had with Alex. “You can’t push the physical limits forever,” he told me. “I’ve already begun my decline, so I won’t be upping the ante forever. I’m training better and climbing better and smarter than I was five or six years ago, but physiologically I’ll never have the body I did when I was twenty-four. That’s just the biology of it.”

- I was trying to picture how scrappy Peter must have been as a feral kid running wild in the hills of British Columbia, when Alex said, “Do you think its douchey that I have a movie crew?” A long pause followed before Peter answered. “People asked me if I would solo Astroman again [for the camera], but I didn’t want to. It was so incredibly important to be doing it for the right reasons. It was just a matter of self-preservation, because I didn’t want to risk being distracted. I’ve just always looked at soloing as something incredibly selfish. I don’t mean it negatively, more just that it’s not for anyone else.” “I think I’m doing it for the right reasons,” said Alex. “But yeah, from the outside it looks bad.”

- “What are you doing?” said Alex. “What does it look like I’m doing?” replied Sanni. “I’m throwing this away.” “But there’s still some left in there,” he said. Sanni held up the bag, and indeed, there was a tiny pinch of yellow cheese lining the seam along the bottom—enough to make a nice meal for a small mouse. Sanni rolled her eyes and put the bag in the minifridge.

- The biggest problem Alex had run into so far while rehearsing the various sections of Freerider was the heat. Most days, by ten A.M. the rock was baking. Hot rock is not a climber’s friend. It feels greasy, and it shreds your skin. But nature trends toward a state of equilibrium, and in a narrow corridor like Yosemite, heat that builds on the valley floor has only one place to go—up. These updrafts are a daily occurrence on a hot day in Yosemite, and for a climber high on the face of El Capitan, the cooling breeze is always most welcome.

- I have climbed El Capitan twenty-three times, and not once have I even considered trying to find the actual summit. One thing is sure: There is no easy way to get to the top of this cliff. Hikers have a few different options. From Tamarack Flat Campground on the Tioga Road, it’s a fifteen-mile round-trip. Another option is the Yosemite Falls Trail, which has the advantage of starting right from the valley floor but the disadvantage of being so long that most people can’t make the round trip in a day. Climbers have access to what is probably the easiest way to get to the top, the East Ledges, El Cap’s standard descent route. This is the route Alex had been taking and was the route we would follow this morning, as we labored to gain 3,000 feet of elevation in less than a mile of hiking.

- We found Jimmy and the other guys sitting on a sandy ledge about thirty feet above the top out for Freerider. Jimmy was eating gummy bears and had his shirt off and his pants unzipped. “Did you guys stop at the tree?” he asked. I nodded affirmatively as I plopped down a few feet in front of him. “Did you look inside?” “No.” “Dean’s urn is in there,” said Jimmy. “We scattered his ashes off the top of Freerider after his memorial.” Right then, as if on cue, a raven landed on a scraggly tree a few yards away. The raven was Dean’s totem.

- “Hey, I hate to bring this up, but we need to talk about what we write if Alex falls,” Gwin said. The editors at National Geographic had discussed this gut-wrenching scenario at length and had even debated whether or not to cover Alex’s attempt. Would it be seen in some quarters as promoting dangerous behavior? Could it be construed as ghoulish voyeurism? Ultimately, they concluded that—just as National Geographic had covered the first ascent of Mount Everest in 1953, which many at the time considered a suicidal endeavor, and many other dangerous climbing expeditions—if Alex was going to attempt to free solo El Capitan, National Geographic was going to cover it, whatever the outcome.

- It took less than a minute for Alex to enter the death zone. Once you’re one hundred feet above the ground, you might as well be a thousand—the fall will be equally fatal. There’s a rule of thumb climbers use to calculate the odds of dying in a ground fall. Land badly (i.e., on your head) from ten feet above the ground, and the chance of it being fatal is 10 percent. At twenty feet, 20 percent. From thirty feet up, you’ll hit the ground at thirty miles per hour. This would be like riding a bike at full speed into a brick wall. The equation is straightforward—the higher you get, the harder you hit that wall. That is, until you reach terminal velocity—about 122 miles per hour. Factoring in air resistance, it takes a falling body approximately twelve to fourteen seconds to reach this speed. This equates to a free fall of about 1,900 feet, or roughly the height of One World Trade Center, including the spire. But it’s not necessary to reach terminal velocity for a fall to be fatal.

- A good many of the free climbs in Yosemite, including this section of Freerider, are possible (at anywhere near their current rating) only because of the artificial piton scars left behind as permanent reminders of the golden age. We love to celebrate the purity of our sport—communing with nature, living life on its simplest terms—but the truth is that it’s all based on a haphazard short history full of human error and compromise.

- The hardest moves ever climbed without a rope are three full number grades harder than this slab. In 2004, one of Germany’s top rock climbers, Alexander Huber, free soloed a route called Kommunist, rated 5.14a. The crux is approximately thirty-three feet above the ground, but Huber intentionally avoided using bouldering crash pads that could have softened a potential fall. In an interview afterward he said, “I worked on the route until the moment I could perfectly control it under good conditions. I was convinced I wouldn’t fall, but like anything in life, you never know 100 percent. This sliver of potential danger is the essence of alpinism and climbing.”

- I remember learning, in my high school statistics class, about the exponential nature of probability. If there’s a 99 percent chance that Alex won’t fall on a difficult free solo, and he exposes himself to these odds one hundred times, the probability that he will survive to share these tales with his grandkids is .99 multiplied by itself one hundred times, or 0.99100, which comes out to .366, or 36.6 percent. Flipped around, that’s a nearly two-thirds chance of a bad outcome. This is a gross oversimplification, especially because Alex is probably several .9s past 99 percent on most of his solos. But the math does reveal an indisputable truth about risk: Keep on taking the risk, and the risk becomes greater.

- When I was Alex’s age, we called it “Kodak courage”—the tendency for people to push beyond their limits when performing for the camera.

- Even more insidious is the way social media has made it possible for people to feel pressure to perform, even when they’re alone. “Engaging in risky behavior so that others will notice us is not a new concept that has only emerged with this generation,” says Jerry Isaak, an associate professor of expeditionary studies at SUNY Plattsburgh. “What is new, however, is the nearly constant ‘virtual presence’ of the others we are trying to impress. With the development of social media and related technology, ‘other people nearby’ has been simultaneously expanded to a potentially worldwide audience and shrunk to the size and portability of a smartphone.”

- For some reason, the nip in the air brought me back to some of the inhospitable places climbing had taken me over the years. Type-two fun, as someone had once described it—god-awful while it’s happening, sublime when it’s over. In a strange way, it felt like that to be heading home. A sense of relief that it was over, that Alex was still alive, but also, a tinge of disappointment. A part of me didn’t want to return to the humdrum of normal, everyday life.

- A college-ruled composition book with a geometric pattern of black and white triangles on its cover sat on the countertop to my left. A random name—Cody Quackenbush—was handwritten on its front. I later found out that Cody was a student of Alex’s mom’s at American River College. I wondered if Cody knew that Alex Honnold was using his notebook for his list of things to do before free soloing El Capitan.

- “I ERASED ALL MY SOCIAL MEDIA,” said Alex, gesturing toward his beat-up iPhone sitting on the van’s countertop. “I don’t want the distraction in these final days, and I’m a little worried about what all the scrolling on my phone might be doing to my brain. I’m kind of nostalgic for the old days before I had a smartphone. I used to do a lot of quality thinking in the box back then.” I had similar concerns. To limit how much Internet I consumed each day, I had been playing recently with an IQ app. Alex’s eyes opened wide when I told him about it. He sat up straight, grabbed his iPhone, and pulled up the App Store. “Which one did you download?” he asked, scrolling down the list and reading the names off to me. “What are the questions like?” “Scrambled words, detecting patterns, math problems, stuff like that. It’s a good way to use parts of your brain that might not see a lot of action, since you probably don’t spend much time thinking in those ways. I know you did a lot of math and science when you were a kid, so think about how much of your brain is sitting unused nowadays.” “It’s funny you mention that. I’ve actually been making a conscious effort to reassign all the neural pathways I used to use for math for memorizing beta.” The beta for Freerider could fill a book.

- “Hey, so I just finished reading this book that I think you’d really like,” said Alex. “It’s called Sapiens.” He explained that the central premise of the book is that humans became the most dominant species on earth because we have the ability to cooperate flexibly in large groups. What gives us this unique ability to cooperate and work together in societies is our belief in shared myths—stories that illustrate universal truths of the human condition. The part Alex thought I would be most interested in was the end, where the book turns from the past to the future and explores what the coming decades may hold for our species. The author, Yuval Noah Harari, speculates that the presently unfolding scientific revolution in technologies like artificial intelligence and bioengineering is leading to a brave new world in which humans may become “amortal.” The difference between an amortal and an immortal is that an amortal can still die—but only in an accident.

- “Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose,” said Steve Jobs, in a commencement address at Stanford in 2005. “You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.”

- I didn’t want to do anything that might psyche Alex out, and for that reason, I didn’t offer my condolences for the loss of his friend Ueli Steck. Less than three weeks earlier, the Swiss Machine had fallen off a 25,800-foot mountain called Nuptse, which lies next to Everest. Steck was climbing solo and moving fast, as he always did. He was acclimatizing for an attempt on Everest’s seldom-climbed Hornbein Couloir, which he planned to solo and then link with a traverse to Lhotse, the world’s fourth-highest mountain. Had he succeeded, it would have been the greatest enchainment in the history of Himalayan climbing. No one knows what happened, but the 3,000-foot fall was witnessed by several Sherpas and Everest climbers in Camps 1 and 2. Presumably, Steck had simply slipped.

- More than the doing of the deed itself, it was the years of anticipation and preparation leading up to it that seemed to me the most impressive thing about this whole endeavor. I imagined that I was Alex and that I had set myself a nearly impossible task—something I absolutely did not have to do. I could walk away. But I didn’t. Instead, I dug in—hard. I broke the inconceivable thing down into bite-size pieces, and every day, I worked on one of them, never worrying about the next, or how they would all eventually fit together.

- Warren Harding, when asked by a reporter why he climbed, famously quipped, “We’re insane. Can’t be any other reason.”

- After Alex’s first attempt on Freerider, Peter Croft put it like this: “The great thing about a climbing hero is that they’re doing something for no good reason at all. To put that much on the line, to work so hard for something that doesn’t have any quantifiable value, it’s just this wonderful, crazy, uniquely human thing.”

- Jimmy once likened Alex to a racehorse: “You can’t hold him back once you let him out of the gate.” In that same conversation, Jimmy also told me that Alex had “fired” him because he moved too slow one day when they were simul-climbing on the Freeblast.

- Though I can’t possibly know how it would feel to plummet helplessly through the air from some horrific height, it nevertheless has for me a terrifying, visceral reality. I’ve had the falling-to-my-death nightmare many times. Psychologists have reported that it’s one of the most common recurring dreams.

- Have you ever stood near the edge of a high place, like a rooftop, or a cliff-side overlook, and felt a strange compulsion to step off the edge, almost like the abyss was calling to you, beckoning you to take that leap into the void? If there was nothing between you and oblivion but one hand clinging to a rock, can you say with 100 percent certainty that you wouldn’t just let go? As I asked myself this question and tried to quantify things that are probably unquantifiable, I wondered if this fear of a kind of suicide, the fear that perhaps we’re not actually in control of our actions and thoughts, lies at the heart of why people react so viscerally to free soloing.

- On the hike out, Alex stopped to look at his phone. I thought he was texting until he said, “Wow, Trump just pulled us out of the Paris accord. That is so depressing.” The news had just broken that minute. Alex looked dejected. “You knew he was going to do it, didn’t you?” “I know they were saying so, but I was still hoping.” Alex doesn’t talk much about his environmentalism, but it’s one of his most deeply held convictions. Ted Hesser, the guy who shared his energy reports with Alex and now works for the Honnold Foundation, told me that Alex had recently written a 50,000-dollar check to help jump-start a grassroots solar-power initiative in Ethiopia. This was the first I’d heard about it. If I hadn’t gone climbing with Ted, I never would have known. There were no press releases, no posts on Alex’s social media.

- For every athlete who has a personal best at the Olympics, there are a dozen more who don’t peak right when they need to.

- When we got to my car we could see Tom Evans and a few other people sitting under a tree on the east side of the meadow with a giant spotting scope trained on the wall. Undoubtedly, they had just watched Alex rappel Freerider. Tom, who’s in his seventies and has climbed El Capitan five times, runs a website called the ElCap Report, which chronicles the doings on El Cap with photos and daily blogs. He’s a friend of Alex’s and has been in the meadow observing and recording almost everything Alex has done on El Capitan since he first showed up in the valley more than a decade ago. Alex told me that Tom knew about the plan and had asked if Alex would give him a heads-up before he went for it so he could photograph the ascent. “How does he know?” I asked. “Because he’s not stupid,” replied Alex.

- We say that we climb for our souls, but the truth is that most of us need to share the experience with others to make it meaningful.

- ON PAPER, THE MONSTER OFFWIDTH appears to be one of the easier pitches on Freerider. The topo shows a straight black line, and the grade is listed at 5.11a. But climbers familiar with this route know that the Monster got its name because it’s been known to eat people alive. An off-width is the name for any crack that is too wide for standard jamming technique. A slotted hand or a sideways clenched fist will usually jam well in a crack up to four inches wide. Any wider, and you have to get creative with moves like hand stacks, arm bars, and chicken wings. The big difference between off-widths and regular cracks is that you often can’t hang off one arm while moving the other up, which means you have to lock yourself into the crack between moves with your legs. Off-width climbing is like trying to run up a steep hill wearing a heavy pack. The beta for the Monster on Mountain Project, an online guidebook, recommends carrying enough protection so you can build a mini anchor in the crack to hang off when you vomit from overexertion.

- There are thousands of individual moves on Freerider and, despite memorizing many of them, Alex trusted himself to figure a lot of them out on the fly. When he was in the flow state, his body sometimes knew what to do better than his mind did. This intuitive kinesthetic awareness was how he found a lot of the refinements to his sequences. But the Boulder Problem isn’t like that. As Alex had explained to me in exquisite detail that day in Foresta, there is one way, and only one way, to do it. And he knew that if he screwed it up, if he pushed his thumb against the pencil-eraser hold in the wrong way, it would probably cause his feet to skate off the tiny nubs that were holding him up. And the handholds were so bad that if his foot slipped, there was no way he could check the fall.

- THERE WAS NO CHEERING CROWD when Alex pulled over the final block, no spraying of champagne, no gushing reporters asking him what it felt like to have just completed the greatest rock climb of all time. Alex walked a few feet back from the edge and took off his shirt and shoes. He was covered in chalk from the tips of his fingers all the way up his Popeye-like forearms. He stood on the rim, squinting into the bright morning sun, arms by his sides. It was 9:28 A.M. The first free solo ascent of El Capitan had taken three hours and fifty-six minutes.

- “It’s kind of been a strategy the whole time I’ve worked on this—to look past it, to think what’s beyond, what other stuff I’m excited about. So this just feels like a seminormal day. I want to eat some lunch, I want to get in the shade, and then I’m probably going to hangboard in a bit.” “A normal person would probably take the afternoon off after they free soloed El Cap,” I replied. “But I’ve been hangboarding every other day, and it’s the other day.”
