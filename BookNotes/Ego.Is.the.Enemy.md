### Highlights

- The first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool. —RICHARD FEYNMAN ([Location 197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=197))
- The ego we see most commonly goes by a more casual definition: an unhealthy belief in our own importance. Arrogance. Self-centered ambition. ([Location 210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=210))
- We can’t improve the world if we don’t understand it or ourselves. ([Location 233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=233))
- One must ask: if your belief in yourself is not dependent on actual achievement, then what is it dependent on? The answer, too often when we are just setting out, is nothing. Ego. And this is why we so often see precipitous rises followed by calamitous falls. ([Location 379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=379))
- We will learn that though we think big, we must act and live small in order to accomplish what we seek. Because we will be action and education focused, and forgo validation and status, our ambition will not be grandiose but iterative—one foot in front of the other, learning and growing and putting in the time. ([Location 404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=404))
- It’s a temptation that exists for everyone—for talk and hype to replace action. ([Location 430](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=430))
- It was easier to talk about writing, to do the exciting things related to art and creativity and literature, than to commit the act itself. ([Location 447](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=447))
- Talk depletes us. Talking and doing fight for the same resources. Research shows that while goal visualization is important, after a certain point our mind begins to confuse it with actual progress. The same goes for verbalization. Even talking aloud to ourselves while we work through difficult problems has been shown to significantly decrease insight and breakthroughs. ([Location 463](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=463))
- We talk to fill the void and the uncertainty. ([Location 475](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=475))
- Having authority is not the same as being an authority. Having the right and being right are not the same either. Being promoted doesn’t necessarily mean you’re doing good work and it doesn’t mean you are worthy of promotion ([Location 532](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=532))
- Do I need this? Or is it really about ego? ([Location 569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=569))
- The pretense of knowledge is our most dangerous vice, because it prevents us from getting any better. Studious self-assessment is the antidote. ([Location 610](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=610))
- To become great and to stay great, they must all know what came before, what is going on now, and what comes next. They must internalize the fundamentals of their domain and what surrounds them, without ossifying or becoming stuck in time. They must be always learning. We must all become our own teachers, tutors, and critics. ([Location 626](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=626))
- Passion typically masks a weakness. Its breathlessness and impetuousness and franticness are poor substitutes for discipline, for mastery, for strength and purpose and perseverance. You need to be able to spot this in others and in yourself, because while the origins of passion may be earnest and good, its effects are comical and then monstrous. ([Location 715](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=715))
- What humans require in our ascent is purpose and realism. Purpose, you could say, is like passion with boundaries. Realism is detachment and perspective. ([Location 728](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=728))
- Purpose is about pursuing something outside yourself as opposed to pleasuring yourself. ([Location 733](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=733))
- attach yourself to people and organizations who are already successful and subsume your identity into theirs and move both forward simultaneously. ([Location 787](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=787))
- Imagine if for every person you met, you thought of some way to help them, something you could do for them? And you looked at it in a way that entirely benefited them and not you. The cumulative effect this would have over time would be profound: You’d learn a great deal by solving diverse problems. You’d develop a reputation for being indispensable. You’d have countless new relationships. You’d have an enormous bank of favors to call upon down the road. ([Location 818](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=818))
- A person who thinks all the time has nothing to think about except thoughts, so he loses touch with reality and lives in a world of illusions. —ALAN WATTS ([Location 923](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=923))
- They assume that what they desire is available and proceed to arrange the rest, taking pleasure in thinking through everything they’ll do when they have what they want, thereby making their lazy souls even lazier.” ([Location 945](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=945))
- There’s no one to perform for. There is just work to be done and lessons to be learned, in all that is around us. ([Location 1003](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=1003))
- Pride blunts the very instrument we need to own in order to succeed: our mind. Our ability to learn, to adapt, to be flexible, to build relationships, all of this is dulled by pride. ([Location 1022](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=1022))
- If you’re doing the work and putting in the time, you won’t need to cheat, you won’t need to overcompensate. ([Location 1037](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=1037))
- Receive feedback, maintain hunger, and chart a proper course in life. Pride dulls these senses. Or in other cases, it tunes up other negative parts of ourselves: sensitivity, a persecution complex, the ability to make everything about us. ([Location 1054](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=1054))
- What we don’t protect ourselves against are people and things that make us feel good—or rather, too good. We must prepare for pride and kill it early—or it will kill what we aspire to. We must be on guard against that wild self-confidence and self-obsession. “The first product of self-knowledge is humility,” ([Location 1062](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=1062))
- Our ego wants the ideas and the fact that we aspire to do something about them to be enough. Wants the hours we spend planning and attending conferences or chatting with impressed friends to count toward the tally that success seems to require. It wants to be paid well for its time and it wants to do the fun stuff—the stuff that gets attention, credit, or glory. ([Location 1106](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=1106))
- Because there is work to be done. Work doesn’t want to be good. It is made so, despite the headwind. There is another old expression: You know a workman by the chips they leave. It’s true. To judge your progress properly, just take a look at the floor. ([Location 1140](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=1140))
- Howard Hughes, like so many wealthy people, died in an asylum of his own making. ([Location 1246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=1246))
- It takes a special kind of humility to grasp that you know less, even as you know and grasp more and more. ([Location 1312](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=1312))
- No matter what you’ve done up to this point, you better still be a student. If you’re not still learning, you’re already dying. ([Location 1321](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=1321))
- The solution is as straightforward as it is initially uncomfortable: Pick up a book on a topic you know next to nothing about. Put yourself in rooms where you’re the least knowledgeable person. ([Location 1331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=1331))
- We want so desperately to believe that those who have great empires set out to build one. Why? So we can indulge in the pleasurable planning of ours. ([Location 1373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=1373))
- Crafting stories out of past events is a very human impulse. It’s also dangerous and untrue. Writing our own narrative leads to arrogance. ([Location 1377](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=1377))
- When we are aspiring we must resist the impulse to reverse engineer success from other people’s stories. ([Location 1400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=1400))
- “Keep your identity small,” fits well here. Make it about the work and the principles behind it—not about a glorious vision that makes a good headline. ([Location 1411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=1411))
- That’s how it seems to go: we’re never happy with what we have, we want what others have too. We want to have more than everyone else. We start out knowing what is important to us, but once we’ve achieved it, we lose sight of our priorities. ([Location 1444](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=1444))
- All of us waste precious life doing things we don’t like, to prove ourselves to people we don’t respect, and to get things we don’t want. ([Location 1455](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=1455))
- Far too often, we look at other people and make their approval the standard we feel compelled to meet, and as a result, squander our very potential and purpose. ([Location 1472](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=1472))
- it’s not about beating the other guy. It’s not about having more than the others. It’s about being what you are, and being as good as possible at it, without succumbing to all the things that draw you away from it. It’s about going where you set out to go. About accomplishing the most that you’re capable of in what you choose. ([Location 1475](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=1475))
- If you don’t know how much you need, the default easily becomes: more. And so without thinking, critical energy is diverted from a person’s calling and toward filling a bank account. ([Location 1480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=1480))
- DeLorean couldn’t manage himself, and so he had trouble managing others. ([Location 1615](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=1615))
- Is that to say that managing your image isn’t important? Of course not. Early in your career, you’ll notice that you jump on every opportunity to do so. As you become more accomplished, you’ll realize that so much of it is a distraction from your work—time spent with reporters, with awards, and with marketing are time away from what you really care about. ([Location 1702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=1702))
- In this moment, he was experiencing what the Stoics would call sympatheia—a connectedness with the cosmos. The French philosopher Pierre Hadot has referred to it as the “oceanic feeling.” A sense of belonging to something larger, of realizing that “human things are an infinitesimal point in the immensity.” ([Location 1729](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=1729))
- There’s an old line about how if you want to live happy, live hidden. ([Location 1851](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=1851))
- Most successful people are people you’ve never heard of. They want it that way. It keeps them sober. It helps them do their jobs. ([Location 1856](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=1856))
- “Almost always, your road to victory goes through a place called ‘failure.’” In order to taste success again, we’ve got to understand what led to this moment (or these years) of difficulty, what went wrong and why. ([Location 1989](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=1989))
- We have only minimal control over the rewards for our work and effort—other people’s validation, recognition, rewards. ([Location 2139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=2139))
- “Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to do your best to become the best that you are capable of becoming.” ([Location 2166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=2166))
- The world is, after all, indifferent to what we humans “want.” If we persist in wanting, in needing, we are simply setting ourselves up for resentment or worse. ([Location 2177](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=2177))
- The problem is that when we get our identity tied up in our work, we worry that any kind of failure will then say something bad about us as a person. ([Location 2272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=2272))
- They just hold themselves to a standard that exceeds what society might consider to be objective success. Because of that, they don’t much care what other people think; they care whether they meet their own standards. And these standards are much, much higher than everyone else’s. ([Location 2360](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=2360))
- When you take ego out of the equation, other people’s opinions and external markers won’t matter as much. ([Location 2374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015NTIXWE&location=2374))
