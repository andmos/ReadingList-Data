### Highlights

- Most deadly errors arise from obsolete assumptions.

- The gift of words is the gift of deception and illusion.

- The future remains uncertain and so it should, for it is the canvas upon which we paint our desires. Thus always the human condition faces a beautifully empty canvas. We possess only this moment in which to dedicate ourselves continuously to the sacred presence which we share and create.

- The purpose of argument is to change the nature of truth.
