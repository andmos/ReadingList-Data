### Highlights

- Some things have to be done. It's better to do them, than to live in the fear of them.

- Once you've got a task to do, it's better to do it than live with the fear of it.

- You have to learn to love the small things in life, like a hot bath. You have to love the small things, when you have nothing else.

- Life – the way it really is – is a battle not between good and bad, but between bad and worse. - Joseph Brodsky

- If a man seeks to change the world, he should first understand it.

- Knowledge is often the antidote to fear.

- Well. What can we do, except try to do better?

- The more you learn, the more you realize how little you know. Still, the struggle itself is worthwhile. Knowledge is the root of power, after all.

- The one upside of being a thief; Shev muttered through tight lips, 'is that you can make free with things that don't belong to you. It's practically a requirement of the job.'

- Treat every man like an emperor, you'll offend no one.

- Right words in right ears change the world! They're the only things that can.

- “A man without discipline is no better than a dog. A soldier without discipline is no better than a corpse. Worse, in fact. A corpse is no threat to his comrades.”

- “Some men laugh easily. It makes them winning dinner companions.”

- Patience is the parent of success,

- “The dead can forgive. The dead can be forgiven. The rest of us have better things to do.

- Never trust a man beyond his own interests,

- Money is a different thing to every man, Bialoveld wrote, but always a good thing.

- “Men become accustomed to poison by degrees” Victor Hugo

- Day smirked. “Science.” Shivers didn’t much care for the sound of it. “What’s that? Some other kind of magic?” “No, it most decidedly is not,” sneered Morveer. “Science is a system of rational thought devised to investigate the world and establish the laws by which it operates. The scientist uses those laws to achieve an effect. One which might easily appear magical in the eyes of the primitive.”

- Nowhere was a single coin in evidence. The wealth here was made of words, of ideas, of rumours and lies, too valuable to be held captive in gaudy gold or simple silver.

- “For someone with a weak grip on the language, you like to talk, don’t you? You know what I reckon?” “What?” “People talk a lot when they’ve nothing to say.”

- Shivers heaved out a sigh. “Just trying to make tomorrow that bit better than today is all. I’m one of those… you’ve got a word for it, don’t you?” “Idiots?” He looked sideways at her. “It was a different one I had in mind.” “Optimists.” “That’s the one. I’m an optimist.” “How’s it working out for you?” “Not great, but I keep hoping.” “That’s optimists. You bastards never learn.”

- He was expecting but the single guard within the building, but one should never become blinded by expectations. Caution first, always.

- Jobs done well are rarely done quickly.”

- No plague spreads quicker than panic,

- “Help me. I have to do this… for my brother.” “You sure? The dead are past helping. Vengeance is for you.”

- And that was the trouble with good men. Just so damned expensive.

- “The belief in a supernatural source of evil is not necessary; men alone are quite capable of every wickedness” Joseph Conrad

- Nine-tenths of war is waiting,

- He owned nothing, it had to be said. But his body was his, still. His hands, which had raised up princes to the heights of power and flung them down again. His eyes, which had surveyed the turning points of history. His lips, which had softly kissed the most celebrated beauties of the age.

- “Regrets. The cost of the business, Sazine used to tell me.”

- Reckon you’re up to a job?” “What manner of job?” “Fighting.” Cosca winced. “You always were far too attached to fighting. How often did I tell you? A mercenary has no business getting involved with that nonsense.” “A sword is for rattling, not for drawing.” “There’s my girl. I’ve missed you.” He said it without thinking, had to cough down his shame and nearly coughed up a lung.

- He had learned long ago that life became much easier if you ignored what was not right before you. For now the stew was his only concern.

- “I don’t trust a man who drinks,” he growled, not bothered about dressing it up. “A man takes to drinking, then he gets weak, then his mind goes.” Cosca sadly shook his head. “You have it back to front. A man’s mind goes, then he gets weak, then he takes to drink. The bottle is the symptom, not the cause.

- You have to blow with the wind in this business. Loyalty on a mercenary is like armour on a swimmer.”

- “You live long enough, you see everything ruined.

- The people far prefer a leader who appears great, Bialoveld wrote, to one who is.

- “The memories of our glories fade,” he whispered, “and rot away into half-arsed anecdotes, thin and unconvincing as some other bastard’s lies. The failures, the disappointments, the regrets, they stay raw as the moments they happened. A pretty girl’s smile, never acted on. A petty wrong we let another take the blame for. A nameless shoulder that knocked us in a crowd and left us stewing for days, for months. Forever.” He curled his lip. “This is the stuff the past is made of. The wretched moments that make us what we are.”

- You put a mask on a person, something weird happens. Changes the way they act along with the way they look. Sometimes they don’t seem like people at all no more, but something else.

- “Shit at least makes flowers grow. Honour isn’t even that useful.”

- At the far end of the room an old man was oiling the lucky wheel. Not too lucky for those that played it, by Friendly’s assessment of the odds. That was the strange thing about games of chance. The chances were always against the player. You might beat the numbers for a day, but you could never beat them in the end.

- Vengeance, then. A double-edged blade if ever there was one. You never could tell when that bastard was going to cut you.

- “War without fire is as worthless as sausages without mustard” Henry V

- The grand duke stared at Shenkt for a long moment and Shenkt stared back, the hall cloaked all the while in that oppressive silence that only great spaces can produce. “So this is he. Why is he not kneeling?” “He does not kneel, apparently,” said Ganmark. “Everyone else kneels. What makes you special?” “Nothing,” said Shenkt. “But you do not kneel.” “I used to. Long ago. No more.” Orso’s eyes narrowed. “And what if a man tried to make you?” “Some have tried.” “And?” “And I do not kneel.” “Stand, then. My son is dead.” “You have my sorrow.” “You do not sound sorrowful.” “He was not my son.”

- “You like to speak the truth, I see. Blunt counsel is a valuable thing to powerful men.

- It’s always the poor who are crushed under rich men’s ambitions. And yet they rarely complain, because… well…” “They dream of having towers o’ their own?” Cosca chuckled. “Why, yes, I suppose they do. They don’t see that the higher you climb, the further you have to fall.” “Men rarely see that ’til the ground’s rushing at ’em.”

- War killed some soldiers, sure, but it left the rest with money, and songs to sing, and a fire to sit around. It killed a lot more farmers, and left the rest with nought but ashes.

- “My old mentor Sazine once told me you should laugh every moment you live, for you’ll find it decidedly difficult afterwards.”

- “Dying rich is still dying.”

- Not that Visserine wasn’t crawling with people. Some were running, making for docks or gates. Men and women with packs, everything they could save on their backs, children in tow, elders shuffling behind. Wagons rattled along stacked with sacks and boxes, with mattresses and chests of drawers, with all manner of useless junk that would no doubt end up abandoned, lining one road or another out of Visserine. A waste of time and effort, trying to save anything but your lives at a time like this. You chose to run, you’d best run fast.

- I have seen hell, Stolicus wrote, and it is a great city under siege.

- “You know what I told you.” “Never trust your own employer.”

- “Five times I have been under siege, and always quite relished the experience. It has a wonderful way of limiting the options. Of freeing the mind.” Cosca took a long breath in through his nose and blew it happily out. “When life is a cell, there is nothing more liberating than captivity.”

- If you wanted a thing, why burn it? And if you did not want it, why fight to take it from someone else? Men

- We liked to torch a building or two in my day, just to get things moving, but nothing like this. War used to be about making money. Some degree of modest misery was a regrettable side effect. Now it’s just about destroying things, and the more thoroughly the better. Science, my friend, science. Supposed to make life easier, I thought.”

- Duke Salier was busy reminiscing on past glories, as men are prone to do when their glories are far behind them.

- Decisiveness has never been my greatest talent. I am too prone to think on what is lost by a certain course of action. To look with longing at all those doors that will be closed, rather than the possibilities presented by the one that I must open.”

- There was such a thing as too much truth, especially in the ears of powerful men.

- To the starving man, bread is beautiful. To the homeless man, a roof is beautiful. To the drunkard, wine is beautiful. Only those who want for nothing else need find beauty in a lump of rock.

- “A man sleeps through most of his life, even when awake. You get so little time, yet still you spend it utterly oblivious. Angry, frustrated, fixated on meaningless nothings. That drawer does not close flush with the front of my desk. What cards does my opponent hold, and how much money can I win from him? I wish I were taller. What will I have for dinner, for I am not fond of parsnips?” Shenkt rolled a mangled corpse out of his way with the toe of one boot. “It takes a moment like this to jerk us to our senses, to draw our eyes from the mud to the heavens, to root our attention in the present. Now you realise how precious is each moment. That is my gift to you.”

- A good general gets to know the smell of panic, and suddenly it was reeking.

- “I’ve no appetite,” she said glumly. “I’ve never faced certain death before.” “Oh, come, come, don’t say such a thing.” He stood, brushed the blossom from the captain’s insignia on the sleeves of his stolen uniform. “If there is one thing I have learned in all my many last stands, it is that death is never certain, only… extremely likely.” “Truly inspirational words.” “I try. Indeed I do.”

- But that was the thing about facing death, as Benna had often pointed out. The closer it gets, the worse an idea it seems.

- Monza raised her brows. A strange group she’d gathered, surely, but when you have a half-mad plan you need men at least half-mad to see it through. Sane ones might be tempted to look for a better idea.

- It is a deplorable thing to run from the enemy, Farans wrote, but often better than the alternative.

- “Revenge. If you could even get it, what good would it do you? All this expenditure of effort, pain, treasure, blood, for what? Who is ever left better off for it?” His sad eyes watched her slowly stand. “Not the avenged dead, certainly. They rot on, regardless. Not those who are avenged upon, of course. Corpses all. And what of the ones who take vengeance, what of them? Do they sleep easier, do you suppose, once they have heaped murder on murder? Sown the bloody seeds of a hundred other retributions?” She circled around, trying to think of some trick to kill him with. “All those dead men at that bank in Westport, that was your righteous work, I suppose? And the carnage at Cardotti’s, a fair and proportionate reply?” “What had to be done!” “Ah, what had to be done. The favourite excuse of unexamined evil echoes down the ages and slobbers from your twisted mouth.”

- The pain had swept away all his doubts, his fears, his questions, his choices. All that shit had been dead weight on him. All that shit was weakness, and lies, and a waste of effort. He’d made himself think things were complicated when they were beautifully, awfully simple.

- “Good order. For a retreat.” Shivers’ voice had withered to a throaty whisper in Visserine. Vitari snorted. “If there’s one thing Rogont knows how to manage it’s a retreat. He’s had enough practice.” “One must appreciate the irony,” observed Morveer, watching the soldiers pass with a look of faint scorn. “Today’s proud legions march over the last vestiges of yesterday’s fallen empire. So it always is with military splendour. Hubris made flesh.”

- On a table beside it a neat row of instruments were laid out. Blades, needles, clamps, pliers. Surgeon’s tools. That room might’ve given him a cold tremble fit to match his name once, but no more. He’d had his eye burned out of his face, and lived to learn the lessons. The world hardly seemed to have any horrors left. Made him smile, to think how scared he’d always been before. Scared of everything and nothing.

- She’d been making fools of these very men for the past few years and the more of a fool a man is, the less he cares to look like one.

- Still, the general with the smallest numbers should remain always on the offensive, Stolicus wrote.

- “Men love to talk about fighting.” Monza let her eyes wander over the sullen faces of Rogont’s advisors. “Some like to dress for it, too. Getting blood on the uniforms is a different matter.”

- Powerful men are as inconstant as the shifting water.

- “Look at me, Rogont, I’m almost as desperate as you are. ‘Great tempests,’ Farans said, ‘wash up strange companions.’ ”

- But she’d found there’s a problem with hiding a thing yourself. You always know where it is.

- Work well done is its own reward, my father always used to tell me.

- I’ve got my pride, still. Man’s got to be what he is, I reckon. Otherwise what is he? Just pretending, no? And who wants to spend all the time they’re given pretending to be what they ain’t?”

- There’s no chief in the world so sure of himself he don’t worry some.

- “Right y’are, General. Nice and simple, eh?” “Nothing worse than too much plan. More there is to remember, more there is to make a shit of.

- Strong leaders might like it when someone brings ’em a better idea, but weak ones never do.

- There’s nothing worse’n too much plan, that’s true. But too little comes in close behind.

- Dignity wasn’t much help to the living, it was none to the dead.

- “Fucking science,” he muttered. “Even worse’n magic.”

- “One of your killers killed the other. There’s killers for you.”

- She rode through them the way she used to, shoulders back, chin up, sneer locked on her mouth, not even bothering to look. As if they were nothing to her. As if she was a better kind of animal than they were. And all the while she prayed silently they didn’t work out what they’d never worked out yet, but what she was always afraid to the pit of her stomach they would. That she didn’t know what the hell she was doing, and a knife would kill her just as dead as anyone else.

- Mercenaries are cowards, on the whole, even more so than most people. Men who’ll kill because it’s the easiest way they’ve found to make a living. Mercenaries have no loyalty in them, on the whole, by definition. Not much to their leaders, even less to their employers.

- a plan too brittle to bend with circumstances is worse than no plan at all.

- You make yourself too hard, you make yourself brittle too. Crack once, crack all to pieces.

- “I like a look of agony, because I know it’s true” Emily Dickinson

- “You sure the night before your own destruction is the best time to celebrate?” “The day after might be too late.”

- One man’s villain is another’s hero, after all.”

- “Thank you, my friend, you are a rock! An anchor! An axle of calm about which I madly spin.

- May Mistress Luck be always at your side and mine! She is drawn, after all, to those who least deserve her!

- “Ah, my friend, you have seen captain generals come and go. You well know there is a happy time, after a man is elevated to command, in which he can say and do no wrong in the eyes of his men. Like a husband in the eyes of his new wife, just following the marriage. Alas, it cannot last.

- ‘Desperation bakes heroes from the most rotten flour,’

- Some men slowing, wanting to get back, others moving faster, wanting to press on. Fear and anger, two sides to the same coin.

- But in any case, a man can forgive all manner of faults in beautiful women that in ugly men he finds entirely beyond sufferance. And if there’s one thing I absolutely cannot abide, it’s disloyalty. You have to stick at something in your life.”

- ‘Unhappy the land that is in need of heroes’ Bertolt Brecht

- Strange thing, that–the fewer years you have to lose the more you fear the losing of ’em.

- ‘Imagine yourself a master mason, Lord Marshal, working upon one turret of a grand palace. A craftsman whose dedication, skill and attention to detail are disputed by no one.’ ‘Mason?’ Mitterick looked baffled. ‘Then imagine the Closed Council as the architects. Our responsibility is not the fitting of one stone to another, it is the design of the building overall. The politics, rather than the tactics. An army is an instrument of government. It must be used in such a way that it furthers the interests of government. Otherwise what use is it? Only an extremely costly machine for … minting medals.’

- ‘The world is fluid. We must be fluid also.

- Naturally, as soldiers, you all are prone to be sentimental about warfare. But fighting is only any use when it’s cheaper than the alternatives.’

- Hard to believe there was any war at all. But then in Craw’s experience, and he’d plenty, wars were made from ninety-nine parts boredom, usually in the cold and damp, hungry and ill, often hauling a great weight of metal uphill, to one part arse-opening terror.

- Craw worried too much, all right. Shame is, a man can’t just choose not to worry.

- ‘You have before you a perfect demonstration of the workings of the army–the chain of command, trooper, each man shitting on the head of the man below. The much-loved leader of our regiment, Colonel Vallimir, is just getting shat on by General Jalenhorm. Colonel Vallimir will shit on his own officers, and it won’t take long to roll downhill, believe me. Within a minute or two, First Sergeant Forest will arrive to position his bared buttocks above my undeserving head. Guess what that means for you lot?’

- Savour the little moments, son, that’s my advice. They’re what life is. All the things that happen while you’re waiting for something else.

- But he’d long ago learned that most men love nothing better than to be listened to. Especially powerful men.

- When the best you can get from your wife’s father is that he won’t help to kill you, it doesn’t take a clever man to see you’re in shit to your chin.

- When you’re planning what to do, always think of doing nothing first, see where that gets you.

- People like simple stories.’ Craw frowned at the pink marks down the edges of his nails. ‘But people ain’t simple.’

- There’s nothing better for a dose of terror than standing by someone even more terrified than yourself.

- Just keep in mind what Rudd Threetrees once told me. Let’s us get them killed, and not the other way round.’ Wonderful grinned. ‘Best damn advice about war I ever heard.’

- ‘A man should always be armed. If only for the feel of it.’ ‘An unarmed man is like an unroofed house,’ muttered Yon. ‘They’ll both end up leaking,’ Brack finished for him.

- More quiet. War’s ninety-nine parts boredom and, now and then, one part arse-opening terror.

- A good leader can’t dwell on the choices he’s made, Threetrees used to tell him, and a good leader can’t help dwelling on ’em.

- What is love anyway, but finding someone who suits you? Someone who makes up for your shortcomings? Someone you can work with. Work on.

- Aliz blinked. ‘You’re so knowledgeable …’ Finree very much wanted to say, ‘yes, I am’ but settled for a careless shrug. There was no magic to it. She simply listened, observed, and made sure she never spoke until she knew what she was speaking of. Knowledge is the root of power, after all.

- It is easy to forget how much you have, when your eyes are always fixed on what you have not.

- You can say things at a grave would get you laughed out of a tavern, and be treated like you’re brimming over with wisdom.

- Life only rolls one way and it ain’t always the way we’d like. There it is.’

- I think you know this, and have no confidence, which makes you behave, paradoxically, as if you have far too much.

- ‘Look. You think how stupid people are most of the time. Old men drunk. Women at a village fair. Boys throwing stones at birds. Life. The foolishness and the vanity, the selfishness and the waste. The pettiness, the silliness. You think in a war it must be different. Must be better. With death around the corner, men united against hardship, the cunning of the enemy, people must think harder, faster, be … better. Be heroic.’ He started to heave his packages down from his horse’s saddle. ‘Only it’s just the same. In fact, do you know, because of all that pressure, and worry, and fear, it’s worse. There aren’t many men who think clearest when the stakes are highest. So people are even stupider in a war than the rest of the time. Thinking about how they’ll dodge the blame, or grab the glory, or save their skins, rather than about what will actually work. There’s no job that forgives stupidity more than soldiering. No job that encourages it more.’

- ‘Any trick looks thin to them who know it’s coming.’

- The battlefield was no place for independent thought, Lasmark supposed, and perhaps his superiors simply knew better than he did. Alas, experience did not support that conclusion.

- There is a gulf of difference, after all, between expecting the worst and seeing it happen.

- Dignity ain’t much use to the living, it’s none to the dead.

- When a man dies in peacetime it’s all tears and processions, friends and neighbours offering each other comfort. A man dies in war and he’s lucky to get enough mud on top to stop him stinking.

- If victory makes men brave, defeat renders them cowards.

- ‘Ah! Tea! Nothing seems quite so terrible once there is a cup of tea in your hand, eh? Would anyone else care for some?’

- ‘Nothing can be beneath the notice of a careful man,’ said the Magus. ‘Knowledge is the root of power, after all.

- ‘If a mason builds a wall upon a slope and it collapses, he can hardly complain that it would have stood a thousand years if only he had been given level ground to work with.’

- Take victory quiet and careful, Rudd Threetrees used to say, ’cause you might soon be called on to take defeat the same way.

- But what kind of man steps away from a friend just ’cause he isn’t popular? Even if he is in danger of becoming a fireball.

- ‘War’s a way of getting things,’ he said. ‘If it gets you nothing, what’s the point?

- It’s amazing how well the most pathetic flattery can work. On enormously vain people especially.

- Pits full of shit, and pits full of corpses. That’s all war left behind, as far as he could see.

- Nothing else but silence. Calder didn’t like a silent man. A boastful man like Golden, an angry man like Tenways, even a savage man like Black Dow, they give you something to work with. A quiet man like Ironhead gives nothing. Especially in the dark, where Calder couldn’t even guess at his thoughts.

- ‘You can’t say that civilisation don’t advance, however, for in every war they kill you in a new way’ Will Rogers

- ‘This is the thing about war. Forces men to do new things with what they have. Forces them to think new ways. No war, no progress.’ He leaned back on one elbow. ‘War, d’you see, is like the plough that keeps the earth rich, like the fire that clears the fields, like—’ ‘The shit that makes the flowers grow?’ asked Wonderful. ‘Exactly!’

- ‘What should we do?’ asked Yolk. ‘Nothing whatsoever, trooper. Unless specifically and precisely instructed otherwise, a good soldier always does nothing.’

- ‘It’s not easy, is it? Being a great man’s son. You’d have thought it would come with all kinds of advantages–with borrowed admiration, and respect. But it’s only as easy as it is for the seeds of a great tree, trying to grow in its choking shadow. Not many make it to the sunlight for themselves.’

- Gorst watched the whirling clouds of gnats that haunted the bank, and the corpses that floated past beneath them. The bravery. Turning with the current. The honour. Face up and face down. The dedication of the soldiers.

- Whoever said war never changes anything, well … they just haven’t fought enough wars, have they? Glad to see this rain’s clearing up, though. It’s been playing hell with my experiment.’

- ‘Once we can kill people at any time of day, in any season, in any weather, why, then we’ll be civilised, eh?’

- People often supposed that a lord marshal wielded supreme power on the battlefield, even beyond an emperor in his throne room. They did not appreciate the infinite constraints on his authority. The weather, in particular, was prone to ignore orders.

- The higher you climbed up the chain of command, the more links between you and the naked steel, the more imperfect the communication became. The more men’s cowardice, rashness, incompetence or, worst of all, good intentions might twist your purposes. The more chance could play a hand, and chance rarely played well.

- The general who waited to make a decision until he knew everything he needed to would never make one, and if he did it would be far too late.

- ‘Oftentimes,’ murmured Whirrun, ‘a man’s better served embracing his pain than trying to escape it. Things are smaller when you face ’em.’

- Anyway, it seems to me a man can do an awful lot of evil in no time at all. Swing of a blade is all it takes. Doing good needs time. And all manner of complicated efforts. Most men don’t have the patience for it. ’Specially not these days.’

- ‘Terrible strain on a man, hearing his self sung about. Enough to make anyone a shit.’ ‘Even if they weren’t one in the first place.’ ‘Which isn’t likely. I guess hearing songs about warriors makes men feel brave their own selves, but a great warrior has to be at least half way mad.’

- ‘Strange bastard, that,’ said Dow as he watched Whirrun go. Craw grunted as he unfolded his legs and slowly stood, shaking his aching joints out. ‘He plays up to it. You know how it is, having a reputation.’ ‘Fame’s a prison, no doubt.

- The Great Leveller’s waiting for all of us, ain’t he? There’ll always be someone stronger, quicker, luckier’n you, and the more fighting you do the quicker he’s going to find you. That’s what life is for men like us.

- ‘A man’s worst enemies are his own ambitions,’

- ‘But that’s being Chief, ain’t it?’ snarled Dow in his face. ‘A dancing fucking procession o’ things you don’t want to do! If I’d known what it meant when I took the chain I’d have tossed it in the river along with the Bloody-Nine. Threetrees warned me, but I didn’t listen. There’s no curse like getting what you want.’

- It’s a damn fool risks his life for what he can get just by the asking.

- Threetrees would’ve been proud. Which was a great comfort, because when he got shot in the neck he could use a dead man’s pride to pull the arrow out, couldn’t he?

- ‘You ever thought about a patch?’ asked Craw, as he took his sword and slid it through his belt. ‘Tried one for a bit.’ Shivers waved a finger at the mass of scar around his eye. ‘Itched like a bastard. I thought, why wear it just to make other fuckers more comfortable? If I can live with having this face, they can live with looking at it. That or they can get fucked.’

- ‘Tell me you lot weren’t working up to a fight without me. You know how much I love killing folk. I shouldn’t, but a man has to stick to what he’s good at.

- His father used to tell him it’s easy to see the enemy one of two ways. As some implacable, terrifying, unstoppable force that can only be feared and never understood. Or some block of wood that doesn’t think, doesn’t move, a dumb target to shoot your plans at. But the enemy is neither one. Imagine he’s you, that he’s no more and no less of a fool, or a coward, or a hero than you are. If you can imagine that, you won’t go too far wrong. The enemy is just a set of men. That’s the realisation that makes war easy. And the one that makes it hard.

- ‘Patience is as fearsome a weapon as rage. More so, in fact, ’cause fewer men have it.’

- But maybe that’s how the world works. Some men are made for doing violence. Some are meant for planning it. Then there are a special few whose talent is for taking the credit.

- ‘Fuck,’ he whispered. ‘Aye,’ said Shivers. Craw almost took a tumble on the wet grass. ’Til he remembered there was an awful lot a man could be saying fuck about. That’s the beauty of the word. It can mean just about anything, depending on how things stand. Horror, shock, pain, fear, worry. None were out of place.

- ‘The definition of all right changes with the passing winters, I find. I’m about all right by the standards of the last few days. Twenty years ago I’d have considered this close to death.’

- ‘You have not thought of everything, then?’ ‘Only the truly ignorant believe they have thought of everything.

- ‘The truth is like salt. Men want to taste a little, but too much makes everyone sick.’

- ‘I fucking love war!’ squeaked Whirrun. ‘I fucking love it, though, don’t you?’ Beck didn’t say anything. ‘The smell of it. The feel of it.’ He rubbed one hand up and down the stained sheath of his sword, making a faint swishing sound. ‘War is honest. There’s no lying to it. You don’t have to say sorry here. Don’t have to hide. You cannot. If you die? So what? You die among friends. Among worthy foes. You die looking the Great Leveller in the eye. If you live? Well, lad, that’s living, isn’t it? A man isn’t truly alive until he’s facing death.’

- ‘If you can rely on one thing in a battle, it’s that men rarely do what’s sensible.’

- ‘There’s no shame in being scared. Bravery is being scared, and doing it anyway.’

- Being in charge can seem like a thing iron-forged, but in the end it’s just an idea everyone agrees to.

- Tears’ll wash no one clean, as Red Hat’s old mum used to tell him.

- ‘You’d think it’d be easy being Chief.’ He shifted his shoulders like the chain sat too heavy on ’em. ‘But it’s like dragging a fucking mountain through the muck. Threetrees told me that. Told me every leader stands alone.’

- That was the trouble with pride, and courage, and all those clench-jawed virtues bards love to harp on. The more you have, the more likely you are to end up bottom in a pile of dead men.

- ‘Every sword’s a weight to carry. Men don’t see that when they pick ’em up. But they get heavier with time.’

- Life is not fair. There is no pattern. People die at random. Obvious, perhaps. Something that everyone knows. Something that everyone knows, but no one truly believes. They think when it comes to them there will be a lesson, a meaning, a story worth telling. That death will come to them as a dread scholar, a fell knight, a terrible emperor. He poked at the boy’s corpse with a toe, rolled it onto its side, then let it flop back. Death is a bored clerk, with too many orders to fill. There is no reckoning. No profound moment. It creeps up on us from behind, and snatches us away while we shit.

- That you’d be forgotten the way a pond forgets a stone tossed in. A few ripples and you’re gone. It’s in the nature of men to forget.

- All you can do is take each day as it comes. Try and do the best you can with what you’re given. You won’t always do the right thing, but you can try. And you can try to do the right thing next time.

- ‘Best to keep your expectations low. Maybe you’ll be pleasantly surprised.’

- ‘Got any advice for me?’ ‘Advice?’ ‘Aye, you’re some fighter.’ ‘If you get a chance, don’t hesitate.’ Shivers frowned down at the ruby on his little finger. ‘Mercy and cowardice are the same.’ ‘My father always used to say that nothing shows greater power than mercy.’ ‘Not in the circle.’

- ‘Who cares a shit what dead men might have said?’ The Dogman stared evenly back. ‘Things change.’

- ‘A good liar tells as much truth as he can. That way you never know what you’re getting.’

- ‘Everyone has their reasons, my father used to tell me. It’s just a question of knowing what they are. Then the world’s simple.’

- I’d also point out loyalty’s a dangerous foundation. Tends to wash away in a storm. Self-interest stands in any weather.’

- ‘Good planning does not prevent accidents,’ said Bayaz, ‘it allows for them. It makes sure every accident is a happy one.

- Remember, because forgetfulness is the curse of power.

- ‘War is full of opportunities, after all, however terrible it may be.’

- If it was someone come to kill him it didn’t seem likely they’d have given him a warning by calling his name. Not unless they were idiots. Idiots can be just as vengeful as anyone else, though, if not more so.

- ‘Gold.’ Wist made the word sound like a mystery there was no solving. ‘Makes men mad.’

- Ain’t like rich folk got no trouble.

- Never make a threat you aren’t at least halfway sure you’ll carry through on.

- Live long enough… you see everything ruined.’

- ‘Better off digging than getting buried,’ said Lamb.

- ‘Ducklings got more fight in ’em than this crowd,’ said Shivers. ‘They’re mercenaries. Fighting is the last thing on their minds.

- In the lunatic asylum, he supposed, the one sane man looks mad.

- ‘You like to drive a bargain, don’t you?’ ‘My preferred approach to bad deals is to be where they ain’t.’

- I never claimed to be a righteous man.’ ‘No righteous man does.’

- ‘A man of principle must make hard choices and suffer the consequences.’

- It might have been a laughable procession without the threat of death. Temple had always found the threat of death to be a sure antidote to comedy.

- ‘This hardly seems a moment for jokes!’ Cosca chuckled. ‘My old commander Sazine once told me you should laugh every moment you live, for you’ll find it decidedly difficult afterward.

- Life rarely turns out the way we expect. We must bend with the circumstances.’

- ‘I think you’re best off treating folk the way you’d want to be treated and leaving their choices to them. We’re all of us trouble o’ one kind or another.

- A sad fact, but the hungrier a man is the less he tends to care about the hunger of others.

- ‘Do you expect trouble?’ asked Majud. ‘Always. That way you’ll only be pleasantly surprised.’

- The best grass is always just past the horizon. The sweetest water’s in the next river. The bluest sky over some other mountain.’ He gave a long sigh. Afore you know it, your joints snap of a morning and you can’t sleep two hours together without needing to piss and of a sudden you realise your best country’s all behind you, never even appreciated as you passed it by, eyes fixed ahead.’

- I’ve always been a deeply disappointing man.’ ‘I know that feeling.’ Lamb scratched slowly at his shortened beard. ‘But there’s always tomorrow. Doing better next time. That’s what life is.’

- ‘I was running away. One way and another I’ve made quite a habit of it.’ ‘Done a fair bit myself. I find the trouble is, though, wherever you run to… there y’are.’

- ‘Good luck’s never a thing to count on,’

- ‘Never own a thing you couldn’t swim a river with, old Corley Ball used to tell me.’ ‘What happened to him?’ asked Shy. ‘Drowned, as I understand.’ ‘Men rarely live by their own lessons,’ murmured Lamb,

- ‘There is no running from the sky!’ he was shrieking, finger outstretched. ‘There is no hiding from God! God is always watching!’ It seemed to Temple he was that most dangerous kind of priest–one who really believes.

- Everyone’s got a better way of doing things ’til they’re called on to actually tell you what it might be.

- ‘But the truth is, it takes no sorcery to make a man do bad things. Bad company. Bad choices. Bad luck. A no more than average level of cowardice.’

- ‘We are all dead men, brother, in due course. It is how we get there that counts.

- ‘Everyone’s got plans,’ said Shy, ‘and everyone thinks theirs are good. It’s when one set of good plans gets tangled with another things tend to slide downhill.’

- No one likes to stand that close to failure, do they? Worried it might rub off.

- ‘Never trust someone who don’t use their proper name, I was always told.’

- The bottle’s a shifty banker–it might lend you courage but it’s apt to call the debt in sudden.

- My old teacher used to say you know the righteous by what they give to those who can’t give back.

- my father always said patience is the king of virtues. A man has to be realistic. Has to be.’

- all his life he’d kept his word. It could give you some tough moments, your word. Could force you into places you didn’t want to be, could serve you up puzzles where the right path weren’t easy to pick. But it wasn’t meant to be easy, it was meant to be right. There were too many men always did the easy thing, regardless.

- Little men and big, brave men and cowards, powerful men and meagre, they all hang very much the same.

- ‘There are many humorous things in the world, among them the white man’s notion that he is less savage than the other savages.’ Mark Twain

- Glory is like bread, it stales with time!

- In violent times folk like to kneel to violent men. In peaceful times they remember they’re happier standing.’

- Folk she’d known to be big on religion had tended to use it as an excuse for doing wrong rather’n a reason not to.

- ‘The Maker taught us it is not fear, but how we face it that counts.

- Evil turned out not to be a grand thing. Not sneering Emperors with world-conquering designs. Not cackling demons plotting in the darkness beyond the world. It was small men with their small acts and their small reasons. It was selfishness and carelessness and waste. It was bad luck, incompetence and stupidity. It was violence divorced from conscience or consequence. It was high ideals, even, and low methods.

- I enjoy a fantastic dream just as much as the next man…’ and he fished up a single golden coin and held it to the light. ‘That one mark is worth a great deal more than a thousand promises.’

- ‘Each land in the world produces its own men individually bad–and, in time, other bad men who kill them for the general good.’ Emerson Hough

- Nostalgia was becoming a favoured hobby of his. Strange, how the best moments of our lives we scarcely notice except in looking back.

- ‘Man’s got to be what he is, I reckon.’

- For as the Prophet said, the man who knows fear every day becomes easy in its company.

- Is not a man who takes on impossible odds generally considered an incorrigible idiot rather than a hero?’

- That’s what courage is. Taking your disappointments and your failures, your guilt and your shame, all the wounds received and inflicted, and sinking them in the past. Starting again. Damning yesterday and facing tomorrow with your head held high. Times change. It’s those that see it coming, and plan for it, and change themselves to suit that prosper.
