### Highlights

- Some things have to be done. It's better to do them, than to live in the fear of them.

- Once you've got a task to do, it's better to do it than live with the fear of it.

- You have to learn to love the small things in life, like a hot bath. You have to love the small things, when you have nothing else.

- Life – the way it really is – is a battle not between good and bad, but between bad and worse. - Joseph Brodsky

- If a man seeks to change the world, he should first understand it.

- Knowledge is often the antidote to fear.

- Well. What can we do, except try to do better?

- The more you learn, the more you realize how little you know. Still, the struggle itself is worthwhile. Knowledge is the root of power, after all.

- The one upside of being a thief; Shev muttered through tight lips, 'is that you can make free with things that don't belong to you. It's practically a requirement of the job.'

- Treat every man like an emperor, you'll offend no one.

- Right words in right ears change the world! They're the only things that can.

- “A man without discipline is no better than a dog. A soldier without discipline is no better than a corpse. Worse, in fact. A corpse is no threat to his comrades.”

- “Some men laugh easily. It makes them winning dinner companions.”

- Patience is the parent of success,

- “The dead can forgive. The dead can be forgiven. The rest of us have better things to do.

- Never trust a man beyond his own interests,

- Money is a different thing to every man, Bialoveld wrote, but always a good thing.

- “Men become accustomed to poison by degrees” Victor Hugo

- Day smirked. “Science.” Shivers didn’t much care for the sound of it. “What’s that? Some other kind of magic?” “No, it most decidedly is not,” sneered Morveer. “Science is a system of rational thought devised to investigate the world and establish the laws by which it operates. The scientist uses those laws to achieve an effect. One which might easily appear magical in the eyes of the primitive.”

- Nowhere was a single coin in evidence. The wealth here was made of words, of ideas, of rumours and lies, too valuable to be held captive in gaudy gold or simple silver.

- “For someone with a weak grip on the language, you like to talk, don’t you? You know what I reckon?” “What?” “People talk a lot when they’ve nothing to say.”

- Shivers heaved out a sigh. “Just trying to make tomorrow that bit better than today is all. I’m one of those… you’ve got a word for it, don’t you?” “Idiots?” He looked sideways at her. “It was a different one I had in mind.” “Optimists.” “That’s the one. I’m an optimist.” “How’s it working out for you?” “Not great, but I keep hoping.” “That’s optimists. You bastards never learn.”

- He was expecting but the single guard within the building, but one should never become blinded by expectations. Caution first, always.

- Jobs done well are rarely done quickly.”

- No plague spreads quicker than panic,

- “Help me. I have to do this… for my brother.” “You sure? The dead are past helping. Vengeance is for you.”

- And that was the trouble with good men. Just so damned expensive.

- “The belief in a supernatural source of evil is not necessary; men alone are quite capable of every wickedness” Joseph Conrad

- Nine-tenths of war is waiting,

- He owned nothing, it had to be said. But his body was his, still. His hands, which had raised up princes to the heights of power and flung them down again. His eyes, which had surveyed the turning points of history. His lips, which had softly kissed the most celebrated beauties of the age.

- “Regrets. The cost of the business, Sazine used to tell me.”

- Reckon you’re up to a job?” “What manner of job?” “Fighting.” Cosca winced. “You always were far too attached to fighting. How often did I tell you? A mercenary has no business getting involved with that nonsense.” “A sword is for rattling, not for drawing.” “There’s my girl. I’ve missed you.” He said it without thinking, had to cough down his shame and nearly coughed up a lung.

- He had learned long ago that life became much easier if you ignored what was not right before you. For now the stew was his only concern.

- “I don’t trust a man who drinks,” he growled, not bothered about dressing it up. “A man takes to drinking, then he gets weak, then his mind goes.” Cosca sadly shook his head. “You have it back to front. A man’s mind goes, then he gets weak, then he takes to drink. The bottle is the symptom, not the cause.

- You have to blow with the wind in this business. Loyalty on a mercenary is like armour on a swimmer.”

- “You live long enough, you see everything ruined.

- The people far prefer a leader who appears great, Bialoveld wrote, to one who is.

- “The memories of our glories fade,” he whispered, “and rot away into half-arsed anecdotes, thin and unconvincing as some other bastard’s lies. The failures, the disappointments, the regrets, they stay raw as the moments they happened. A pretty girl’s smile, never acted on. A petty wrong we let another take the blame for. A nameless shoulder that knocked us in a crowd and left us stewing for days, for months. Forever.” He curled his lip. “This is the stuff the past is made of. The wretched moments that make us what we are.”

- You put a mask on a person, something weird happens. Changes the way they act along with the way they look. Sometimes they don’t seem like people at all no more, but something else.

- “Shit at least makes flowers grow. Honour isn’t even that useful.”

- At the far end of the room an old man was oiling the lucky wheel. Not too lucky for those that played it, by Friendly’s assessment of the odds. That was the strange thing about games of chance. The chances were always against the player. You might beat the numbers for a day, but you could never beat them in the end.

- Vengeance, then. A double-edged blade if ever there was one. You never could tell when that bastard was going to cut you.

- “War without fire is as worthless as sausages without mustard” Henry V

- The grand duke stared at Shenkt for a long moment and Shenkt stared back, the hall cloaked all the while in that oppressive silence that only great spaces can produce. “So this is he. Why is he not kneeling?” “He does not kneel, apparently,” said Ganmark. “Everyone else kneels. What makes you special?” “Nothing,” said Shenkt. “But you do not kneel.” “I used to. Long ago. No more.” Orso’s eyes narrowed. “And what if a man tried to make you?” “Some have tried.” “And?” “And I do not kneel.” “Stand, then. My son is dead.” “You have my sorrow.” “You do not sound sorrowful.” “He was not my son.”

- “You like to speak the truth, I see. Blunt counsel is a valuable thing to powerful men.

- It’s always the poor who are crushed under rich men’s ambitions. And yet they rarely complain, because… well…” “They dream of having towers o’ their own?” Cosca chuckled. “Why, yes, I suppose they do. They don’t see that the higher you climb, the further you have to fall.” “Men rarely see that ’til the ground’s rushing at ’em.”

- War killed some soldiers, sure, but it left the rest with money, and songs to sing, and a fire to sit around. It killed a lot more farmers, and left the rest with nought but ashes.

- “My old mentor Sazine once told me you should laugh every moment you live, for you’ll find it decidedly difficult afterwards.”

- “Dying rich is still dying.”

- Not that Visserine wasn’t crawling with people. Some were running, making for docks or gates. Men and women with packs, everything they could save on their backs, children in tow, elders shuffling behind. Wagons rattled along stacked with sacks and boxes, with mattresses and chests of drawers, with all manner of useless junk that would no doubt end up abandoned, lining one road or another out of Visserine. A waste of time and effort, trying to save anything but your lives at a time like this. You chose to run, you’d best run fast.

- I have seen hell, Stolicus wrote, and it is a great city under siege.

- “You know what I told you.” “Never trust your own employer.”

- “Five times I have been under siege, and always quite relished the experience. It has a wonderful way of limiting the options. Of freeing the mind.” Cosca took a long breath in through his nose and blew it happily out. “When life is a cell, there is nothing more liberating than captivity.”

- If you wanted a thing, why burn it? And if you did not want it, why fight to take it from someone else? Men

- We liked to torch a building or two in my day, just to get things moving, but nothing like this. War used to be about making money. Some degree of modest misery was a regrettable side effect. Now it’s just about destroying things, and the more thoroughly the better. Science, my friend, science. Supposed to make life easier, I thought.”

- Duke Salier was busy reminiscing on past glories, as men are prone to do when their glories are far behind them.

- Decisiveness has never been my greatest talent. I am too prone to think on what is lost by a certain course of action. To look with longing at all those doors that will be closed, rather than the possibilities presented by the one that I must open.”

- There was such a thing as too much truth, especially in the ears of powerful men.

- To the starving man, bread is beautiful. To the homeless man, a roof is beautiful. To the drunkard, wine is beautiful. Only those who want for nothing else need find beauty in a lump of rock.

- “A man sleeps through most of his life, even when awake. You get so little time, yet still you spend it utterly oblivious. Angry, frustrated, fixated on meaningless nothings. That drawer does not close flush with the front of my desk. What cards does my opponent hold, and how much money can I win from him? I wish I were taller. What will I have for dinner, for I am not fond of parsnips?” Shenkt rolled a mangled corpse out of his way with the toe of one boot. “It takes a moment like this to jerk us to our senses, to draw our eyes from the mud to the heavens, to root our attention in the present. Now you realise how precious is each moment. That is my gift to you.”

- A good general gets to know the smell of panic, and suddenly it was reeking.

- “I’ve no appetite,” she said glumly. “I’ve never faced certain death before.” “Oh, come, come, don’t say such a thing.” He stood, brushed the blossom from the captain’s insignia on the sleeves of his stolen uniform. “If there is one thing I have learned in all my many last stands, it is that death is never certain, only… extremely likely.” “Truly inspirational words.” “I try. Indeed I do.”

- But that was the thing about facing death, as Benna had often pointed out. The closer it gets, the worse an idea it seems.

- Monza raised her brows. A strange group she’d gathered, surely, but when you have a half-mad plan you need men at least half-mad to see it through. Sane ones might be tempted to look for a better idea.

- It is a deplorable thing to run from the enemy, Farans wrote, but often better than the alternative.

- “Revenge. If you could even get it, what good would it do you? All this expenditure of effort, pain, treasure, blood, for what? Who is ever left better off for it?” His sad eyes watched her slowly stand. “Not the avenged dead, certainly. They rot on, regardless. Not those who are avenged upon, of course. Corpses all. And what of the ones who take vengeance, what of them? Do they sleep easier, do you suppose, once they have heaped murder on murder? Sown the bloody seeds of a hundred other retributions?” She circled around, trying to think of some trick to kill him with. “All those dead men at that bank in Westport, that was your righteous work, I suppose? And the carnage at Cardotti’s, a fair and proportionate reply?” “What had to be done!” “Ah, what had to be done. The favourite excuse of unexamined evil echoes down the ages and slobbers from your twisted mouth.”

- The pain had swept away all his doubts, his fears, his questions, his choices. All that shit had been dead weight on him. All that shit was weakness, and lies, and a waste of effort. He’d made himself think things were complicated when they were beautifully, awfully simple.

- “Good order. For a retreat.” Shivers’ voice had withered to a throaty whisper in Visserine. Vitari snorted. “If there’s one thing Rogont knows how to manage it’s a retreat. He’s had enough practice.” “One must appreciate the irony,” observed Morveer, watching the soldiers pass with a look of faint scorn. “Today’s proud legions march over the last vestiges of yesterday’s fallen empire. So it always is with military splendour. Hubris made flesh.”

- On a table beside it a neat row of instruments were laid out. Blades, needles, clamps, pliers. Surgeon’s tools. That room might’ve given him a cold tremble fit to match his name once, but no more. He’d had his eye burned out of his face, and lived to learn the lessons. The world hardly seemed to have any horrors left. Made him smile, to think how scared he’d always been before. Scared of everything and nothing.

- She’d been making fools of these very men for the past few years and the more of a fool a man is, the less he cares to look like one.

- Still, the general with the smallest numbers should remain always on the offensive, Stolicus wrote.

- “Men love to talk about fighting.” Monza let her eyes wander over the sullen faces of Rogont’s advisors. “Some like to dress for it, too. Getting blood on the uniforms is a different matter.”

- Powerful men are as inconstant as the shifting water.

- “Look at me, Rogont, I’m almost as desperate as you are. ‘Great tempests,’ Farans said, ‘wash up strange companions.’ ”

- But she’d found there’s a problem with hiding a thing yourself. You always know where it is.

- Work well done is its own reward, my father always used to tell me.

- I’ve got my pride, still. Man’s got to be what he is, I reckon. Otherwise what is he? Just pretending, no? And who wants to spend all the time they’re given pretending to be what they ain’t?”

- There’s no chief in the world so sure of himself he don’t worry some.

- “Right y’are, General. Nice and simple, eh?” “Nothing worse than too much plan. More there is to remember, more there is to make a shit of.

- Strong leaders might like it when someone brings ’em a better idea, but weak ones never do.

- There’s nothing worse’n too much plan, that’s true. But too little comes in close behind.

- Dignity wasn’t much help to the living, it was none to the dead.

- “Fucking science,” he muttered. “Even worse’n magic.”

- “One of your killers killed the other. There’s killers for you.”

- She rode through them the way she used to, shoulders back, chin up, sneer locked on her mouth, not even bothering to look. As if they were nothing to her. As if she was a better kind of animal than they were. And all the while she prayed silently they didn’t work out what they’d never worked out yet, but what she was always afraid to the pit of her stomach they would. That she didn’t know what the hell she was doing, and a knife would kill her just as dead as anyone else.

- Mercenaries are cowards, on the whole, even more so than most people. Men who’ll kill because it’s the easiest way they’ve found to make a living. Mercenaries have no loyalty in them, on the whole, by definition. Not much to their leaders, even less to their employers.

- a plan too brittle to bend with circumstances is worse than no plan at all.

- You make yourself too hard, you make yourself brittle too. Crack once, crack all to pieces.

- “I like a look of agony, because I know it’s true” Emily Dickinson

- “You sure the night before your own destruction is the best time to celebrate?” “The day after might be too late.”

- One man’s villain is another’s hero, after all.”

- “Thank you, my friend, you are a rock! An anchor! An axle of calm about which I madly spin.

- May Mistress Luck be always at your side and mine! She is drawn, after all, to those who least deserve her!

- “Ah, my friend, you have seen captain generals come and go. You well know there is a happy time, after a man is elevated to command, in which he can say and do no wrong in the eyes of his men. Like a husband in the eyes of his new wife, just following the marriage. Alas, it cannot last.

- ‘Desperation bakes heroes from the most rotten flour,’

- Some men slowing, wanting to get back, others moving faster, wanting to press on. Fear and anger, two sides to the same coin.

- But in any case, a man can forgive all manner of faults in beautiful women that in ugly men he finds entirely beyond sufferance. And if there’s one thing I absolutely cannot abide, it’s disloyalty. You have to stick at something in your life.”
