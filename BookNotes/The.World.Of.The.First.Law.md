### Highlights

- Some things have to be done. It's better to do them, than to live in the fear of them.

- Once you've got a task to do, it's better to do it than live with the fear of it.

- You have to learn to love the small things in life, like a hot bath. You have to love the small things, when you have nothing else.

- Life – the way it really is – is a battle not between good and bad, but between bad and worse. - Joseph Brodsky

- If a man seeks to change the world, he should first understand it.

- Knowledge is often the antidote to fear.

- Well. What can we do, except try to do better?

- The more you learn, the more you realize how little you know. Still, the struggle itself is worthwhile. Knowledge is the root of power, after all.

- The one upside of being a thief; Shev muttered through tight lips, 'is that you can make free with things that don't belong to you. It's practically a requirement of the job.'

- Treat every man like an emperor, you'll offend no one.

- Right words in right ears change the world! They're the only things that can.
