### Highlights

- BUZZ OSBORNE (a.k.a. King Buzzo; Melvins singer/guitarist) I never hipped my parents that much to what I was doing musically. But that's okay—they had their own shit going on. They dealt with being parents with the tools that their parents had given them, which was none. My father was born in a West Virginia hovel with no power or running water, and his father was a coal miner. My grandfather left home when he was 12 years old because his father couldn't feed him anymore. He was a hobo. My mom was 15 years old when she had me. My parents never would have fucking gotten married if it wasn't for that. My parents did exceptionally well with what they had, which was nothing, and their parents had nothing, they came from nowhere. That's the way that lots of families are: death and destruction and every bad thing that you can imagine. I have a distrust of humanity. I lost my faith in all those kinds of things a long time ago, probably as a teenager. But that's okay. I understand Im not normal. I'm just a weirdo walking around like Bozo the Clown.

- BUZZ OSBORNE We named the band after this guy who worked at the Thriftway. Melvin was a fucking asshole. He was an adult and was in a position to give you orders. He was the kind of guy who would yell at you in front of somebody else to try to impress them. Horseshit. We wanted to call ourselves that because it sounded stupid.

- KURT BLOCH The Melvins were unlike any other band. They had this absurd sound, which was just pummeling, but at the same time it wasn't like hardcore where you're telling everyone how much you hate your parents and school and stuff like that. The lyrics didn't make any literal sort of sense, but they're yelling them like they mean them. They were very pretentious but without any pretense. They didn't have that whole antigovernment and "kill rock stars" attitude.

- JEFF GILBERT (journalist; KZOK DJ; concert organizer) Seattle isn't a glamorous town at all. It was pretty pathetic. Very depressing. That's where this music came out of. I've made this comment before: Grunge isn't a music style. It's complaining set to a drop D tuning.

- BUZZ OSBORNE We never had any roadies— that's bullshit. They were just friends. Sometimes Krist would drive us places. I always laugh at that: Kurt Cobain was our roadie. Look at him—he could barely lift himself out of bed. A roadie? For what, a flea circus?

- ART CHANTRY (The Rocket newspaper art director; Sub Pop Records freelancer; album/poster designer) There was one famous show at Gorilla Gardens-think it was a Red Rockers show, some people say it was a Butthole Surfers show. The fire department came in and tried to close it down because they didn't have enough fire exits. Everybody was getting really pissed off, so somebody took a chain saw and literally cut a hole in the wall to the alley outside, and the shit went back on. They had a fire exit now, didn't they?

- DUFF MCKAGAN I've heard people quote me as saying, Tm gonna move to L.A. and become a rock star." Then they add, "And he did." Everybody says they knew me in 1984, when they actually didn't. It wasn't any of that. I wanted to be a musician, and the people I was playing with in Seattle, everybody was doing heroin, and I wasn't. Heroin decimated 10 Minute Warning. A friend of mine who was strung out said, "Man, if you don't get out now, it's going to pass you by. You're the guy, you're our hope."

- JOHN BIGLEY Tom goes, "That's fucking Duff!" There's this fuckin wanker wearing a bullet belt, with his pants tucked into his cowboy boots. His hair is all teased out and long and crazy. You know, Hollywood butt-rocker guy. "Duff, what's goin' on? Look at you, man!" He goes, "Got this band goin'. It's goin' really well." "What's it called?" He sighs. "It's the singer's name ..." He whispered it: "It's called Guns N' Roses." Yeah, he was embarrassed. He used to be in a band called the Vains, man. Guns N' Roses?! "The singer is calling himself Axl." Guns N' Roses. Axl. We're all laughin'. "Wow, how magnificent!" I go, "That sounds like fuckin' shit. Good luck with that, you freak" But he was super good-natured about it. The band laughed about it for a couple of days. "Duff’s doing metal" Then, fuck, two years later: "Welcome to the jungle!"

- JOHN LEIGHTON BEEZER (the Thrown Ups bassist; the Blunt Objects guitarist) Todd was hemophiliac, and when kids were born with hemophilia, they used to wrap them up in cotton, like they were fine china. And at a certain point, his mom got fed up with this and said, "Even if he has to die young, he's gonna live like a normal kid." So this was a guy who basically expected to die at any time. Todd was the drummer in our band the Blunt Objects, which also featured Jim Sangster, who ended up playing bass in the Young Fresh Fellows, and John Conte, who went on to a band called the Living, which featured Duff McKagan and Greg Gilmore. Todd's drum set was literally speckled in blood; any little cut would just bleed continuously, and hed have to get a transfusion after every practice. His attitude was, Fuck, we're only here so long, so let's have some fun. I think that's where the attitude of the Blunt Objects came from. And the irony was that Todd did survive well into adulthood, and he didn't die from hemophilia-he died in '96 from AIDS he got from a blood transfusion. Jane's Addiction showed us that you could do something totally different and make it work, which basically caused Green River to break up since the other guys didn't dig it as much as Stone and I did. Our drummer hated them. When we got back to Seattle we just knew we wanted to do something else, something with less limitations, something that had endless possibilities...

- DAN PETERS I was at a show at the OK Hotel. Mark came running up to me, completely hammered, while I was standing in line at the bath-room. He's like, "Green River broke up!" And he was totally psyched. He's like, "Can I cut in front of you to use the bathroom?" When he comes out, he goes, "All right, see you later." I walk in, and he had puked all over the place. Obviously he had been celebrating the fact that Green River broke up, couldn't handle it, and blew it all over the bathroom.

- JACK ENDINO I was making about five bucks an hour working at this little studio. Bands tend to trust people that they know from other bands, as opposed to producers they've never met, and so as a peer I had an advantage. In January 1988, Kurt Cobain called me up at the studio and said, "I don't have a band name, but I've got the Melvins' drummer helping me out. We just want to come up and record some songs." I'd already been a Melvins fan for years, and thought, This is a no-brainer. Let's do it. Between noon and 5 p.m., we recorded and mixed 10 songs. I thought Kurt had a really good scream and a really good melodic approach. And I thought it was good enough that I insisted they let me keep a cassette ofit, and said, "Hey, can I play this for some people?"

- MARK DEUTROM Lori and I were together for about 10 years. We split up, Lori and Buzz got together, Lori joined the band, and I moved to London at that point. Then Buzz called me up and said, "Hey, want to produce our next record?" So I came out from London, and we recorded Ozma. That was, of course, pretty much the Fleetwood Mac scenario.

- BUZZ OSBORNE Cobain had the wounded-junkie look that for some reason women watching MTV think is really cool. I've said this before: If Kurt Cobain looked like Fat Albert-same songs, everything—it wouldn't have worked. Same with Soundgarden. If Chris Cornell looked like Fat Albert, a 500-pound black guy, nobody would have given a shit.

- GRANT ALDEN Sub Pop was in your face: WE'RE RIPPING YOU OFF BIG TIME!—that's what their ad said. This is a record label that managed to finance itself on that Singles Club.

- MARK ARM One of the label's biggest tricks was selling itself so that people would want to get anything on Sub Pop, whether it was good or not, because of the packaging and the label identity. They came up with the Singles Club, getting people to pay [$35 a year] up front without knowing what they were getting. That helped them stay afloat.

- DAVID DUET My girlfriend and I used to do this thing where wed braid our hair and then rub black dye in it, and then rebraid it and rub bleach in it, and rebraid it and rub different colors in it, and then cut the braids off. We called them calico cat-butt hairdos, 'cause it looked like a calico cat's butt. That's where the initial spark for the band name came from. But in radio interviews, I always told a half-true story about my great-grandparents, who at one time were wealthy and had a maid named Sally. She was an old black woman with two fake legs who had a lot of cats and grew her own vegetables and sustained herself very mod-estly. Somehow in my mind what transpired was that she would shave a thin layer of meat off each cat's ass— allowing the other cats time to heal-and then cook it like bacon.

- JAMES BURDYSHAW Tom and Charlie did seven shows with us. The last show we played with them before they finally left to concentrate on the U-Men again, Michael's leg was in a cast, and he made up this story about falling down the stairs at his apartment trying to catch the cat or some nonsense. The truth of the matter is, he broke his foot jumping out of a second-story window of a pharmacy he was rippin' off. He was a total drugstore cowboy, before that movie ever came out.

- JOHN BIGLEY The U-Men got together and did it and it happened and it was over and then you start getting told you're a "bridge builder" and a "gate opener." It's great. I'd seen press stuff saying that here and there, and back in the day, I'd be out getting tea and: "Hey, all right, Mr. Grunge Blueprint!" That's better than a lot of aspects of the music deal that other people experienced. I'm happy with that.

- BRUCE FAIRWEATHER My favorite Tad story that I love telling is when Mudhoney was playing a show at the Motor Sports Garage. My wife and I were sitting on top of Mudhoney's cooler onstage, behind the P.A. Mudhoney are playing, and all of the sudden, I see this shadow go by me, and I look up, and it was Tad. And this is when he was in top form, man—he was probably 400-and-something pounds. He was just run-ning, and he dives into the audience. He took out 20 people. Everyone gets up, and they're just going, "Holy crap!" It was amazing that nobody got killed.

- MATT LUKIN I remember one time the Melvins were playing with Malfunkshun in Olympia. They were setting up the sound check and Andy didn't have a cord to plug his bass in. I lent him one and said, "You came all the way down here, you got your amp and your guitar, but you didn't have a cord?" He goes, "We used to be musicians dabbling in drugs. Now we're druggies dabbling in music."

- KIM THAVIL Mark Arm, myself, and Buzz. Osborne were hanging out at Mark Arm's apartment in the U District, listening to records and BS'ing about bands, around late '86. Buzz mentioned that on a number of Black Sabbath songs, Tony Iommi used a tuning called drop D, where the low-E string was tuned down a whole step. It makes things a little bit lower, a little bit heavier. After that, I went ahead and wrote a number of songs in drop D tuning— the first song I wrote with it was "Nothing to Say" —and then we experimented with other drop tun-ings. People started comparing us to Zeppelin or Black Sabbath, but we weren't listening to those bands then—we were listening to Bauhaus and Killing Joke.

- DAN PETERS I always thought it was ballsy and funny that Soundgarden put out that song "Incessant Mace" that was Led Zeppelin. It sounds just like "Dazed and Confused"!

- MARK PICKEREL When I was in the Screaming Trees, it was really just Van and I that were experimenting with anything at all, and I kept it strictly to booze and pot. Lanegan was totally clean during that period, because after an accident with some farm equipment in '86 or '87—he almost lost his leg—the doctor was like, "With this injury, if you keep drinking, you're not gonna make it." So he had to go cold turkey when he was only about 22.

- JERRY CANTRELL (Alice in Chains guitarist/singer; solo artist) I wasn't really close to my dad, so that affected me heavily. I lived with my grandmother and my mother until they died. Right after my grandmother died— and that was a big enough shock—my mom came home one day and told me that she had about six months to live. And that was so heavy. My mother died of pancreatic cancer at 43.

- JOHNNY BACOLAS The Music Bank was open 24 hours. You could go there and knock on the door at 3 in the morning and the guy that was working the keys would come, look through a peephole, let you in if you had a room there, walk you to your room, unlock it with the key—he had a huge key ring with probably 150 keys on it— and you were good to go. Layne was one of the key guys, and he usually worked the graveyard shift. Jerry was living in our jam room, so in the middle of the night, Jerry would be in the office with Layne, watching TV with his guitar in his hand saying, "Hey, dude, check out this riff. I got this idea." That's quite a big catalyst to that incredible connection those two had.

- MIKE STARR I guess I had met Layne a couple years before, but I dont remember it. I was on acid at the time. I was so high I couldn't even dress myself, so I wore my bathrobe, with underwear on, and my sunglasses and my cowboy boots and rode on my Honda motorcycle to the beach. I heard Layne saying on a New York radio station one time, "When I met Mike Starr, he was on a Honda motorcycle in his bathrobe and his sunglasses. I said to myself right there, "That's the kind of guy I want to be in a band with.'"

- JERRY CANTRELL Layne was playin' with another band, but he came in to jam with us after we'd been playin' together.... He was just such a cool fuckin' guy and his voice was just amazing, and we knew we wanted to be in a band with him right off the bat. So it was just a period of time of waitin' him out. And then that didn't seem to work, so we told him, "We're gonna get a new singer," and we started auditioning singers in his rehearsal room, and we just brought in the shittiest guys we could find. (Laughs.) We auditioned a redheaded male stripper who was just terrible, and that was it. And [Layne] was like, "Fuck it. I can't let you guys play with these fuckin' clowns. I'll fuckin' join the band."

- ROB SKINNER (Coffin Break bassist/singer) Coffin Break shared a room in the Music Bank with Alice in Chains for about a year. Every room there was a party. The girls loved the Alice in Chains guys, so the band would always have these South End or Eastside girls show up with their friends and hang out. They definitely rehearsed and did their thing, but the suburban metal background is a lot different than the punk rock background. There are no girls watching you practice when you're a punk-rock band, let's put it that way.

- TIM BRANOM Alice in Chains played with Mother Love Bone August 1988 at the Central, and that was a really odd pairing because they weren't the same type of bands. Yet they were growing together as friends. I think that started people meshing styles together.

- MIKE STARR When I saw Jeff Ament in Mother Love Bone, I was like, Wow. They just looked different, man, wearing shorts over their long johns, with combat boots. I remember we started dressing like that. We started wearing Value Village clothes and not showering for a while. We were trying to have our big hair and everything at the beginning, and then Layne got dreadlocks. We just kind of molded into whatever they call grunge now.

- KIM THAYIL When they were Alice N' Chains, their first demo probably owed a little bit more to Poison than the huge monster they became. That really changed when they heard us. (Laughs.) Jerry Cantrell and I were at some show, I think it was DOA playing at a venue called the Hall of Fame in the U District. Jerry asked me how to play songs like "Nothing to Say" and "Beyond the Wheel" and was there some kind of weird tuning thing? And I said, "Hey, there's this thing called drop D tuning." And a short time later, they recorded a demo that contained many of the songs that you hear on Facelift and they had drop D tuning on them.

- BOB WHITTAKER My father, Jim Whittaker, is a bit of a Pacific Northwest icon in that he and his twin brother became famous mountaineers, and he was the first American to summit Mount Everest. My father was really good friends with the Kennedy family and with Bobby Kennedy. In fact, I'm named after Bobby. After Bobby was shot, my father was a pallbearer at his funeral. I was never allowed to have squirt guns or toy guns as a kid because of that. When I was in high school in the '80s, I'll never forget my dad walking into my room, where I'm listening to Wasted Youth or whatever, and there on top of the stack was the Dead Kennedys record. I felt hor-rible. Here I am —Bobby Kennedy is my namesake-and I have this sacrilegious record. That was a tough one to explain away.

- JACK ENDINO Bleach was just another album. I thought it was a very good other album, but I thought, Here's another great record that nobody's ever gonna hear.

- MARK ARM The U.K. was so fuckin' class-oriented. Like if rock is going to be authentic it's gotta come from the lower class, which is crazy. I mean, Mick Jagger went to the London School of Economics.

- BRUCE PAVITT It was my contention that people in Europe would get excited about American music if, from their perspective, the bands actually looked or felt more authentically "American." And Europeans don't see Americans as refined. They see them as spirited, but somewhat unmannered. When I told people I was going to the Seattle area to go to col-lege, they were like, "Oh, my God, there's still cowboys and Indians out there." And it was seen as extremely backwoods. This is prior to Microsoft and Starbucks and everything else. In addition, Seattle had very little music history, so it essentially had a clean slate. It didn't have the baggage of San Francisco or New Orleans or Kansas City. So we got to create our own myth.

- EVERETT TRUE It's kind of ironic that this music I absolutely despised and is anathema to everything I love about music, that is the one music I'm credited with inventing! To me, grunge is another crap musical form that MTV invented. The original grunge, the Sub Pop grunge, had nothing to do with the grunge that became popular, like Silverchair and Puddle of Mudd.

- MARK ARM Am I the person responsible for coining the word grunge? I don't think so. In 1981, I wrote a fanzine a fake letter from the perspective of a disgruntled person who happened to stumble upon my shitty band at the time, Mr. Epp. It was fake hate mail. You know, this publicity stuff is very tricky! The word grunge was tossed around a little bit here and there well before I ever used it. Steve Turner picked up this '70s reissue of a Rock 'n' Roll Trio album, and the liner notes talk about Paul Burlison's "grungy guitar sound." That was written in the '70s about a '50s guitar player. Grunge was an adjective; it was never meant to be a noun. If I was using it, it was never meant to coin a movement, it was just to describe raw rock and roll. Then that term got applied to major-label bands putting out slick-sounding records. It's an ill fit.

- BEN SHEPHERD I hate that word grunge. It has nothing to do with any-thing. It's fuckin' concocted bullshit.

- KURT DANIELSON I remember one night in Germany, we were staying in an old hostel that obviously had been an officers' barracks at some point in its past. And for that reason, Krist had nightmares that he was in a Nazi concentration camp. Krist sleepwalks, and he was sharing a room that night with Kurt. He actually punched Kurt, thinking he was a Nazi!

- MEGAN JASPER L7 came into the Sub Pop office, and I think I told you how we would rate bands on how much they smelled? No? It wasn't an official list, but our accountant, Geoff Kirk, would make jokes and write it down. L7 were on the list, but Babes in Toyland were the smelliest. Geoff actually followed them around one time with a Glade air-freshener, spraying them. Nirvana was also on the list. Those were the three biggies. It was mostly the drummer, Chad. One time it smelled so bad in the office when Nirvana was there—it was beyond a human smell; it smelled like yeast or something— and everyone was trying to open the windows. Because I didn't think it was a person, I said, "What is that smell?!" And Chad said, "Oh, I think it's me."

- NANCY WILSON There was such an amazing community that only gelled further from Andy's memorial. 'Cause everybody came to Kelly Curtis's house that night. I had three springer spaniels and I decided to bring those dogs to the house, and everybody at the place took turns getting down on the ground and hugging the dogs because it was really comforting. There's such a family aspect to the Seattle music scene. We just felt really completely honored to be included because we figured they'd written Heart off a long time ago as just some dinosaur.

- ROBERT SCOTT CRANE Seattle absolutely lost its soul when Andy Wood died. But I feel like the soul started to get sucked out of Seattle with the signing of Mother Love Bone. Because although I was really excited for my friend getting signed to a major label, I knew that essentially Mother Love Bone was a sellout that just wanted to be Guns N' Roses. Coming from Green River and Malfunkshun, they took a huge shift to be a major-label band. They just absolutely sold their souls. Andy still kept his soul as a person. He was the light, fun part of Seattle, as opposed to the other side, like the Jerry Cantrells— and I would even put Chris Cornell into this—the brooding, quiet, angry types.

- CHRIS CORNELL We were crammed in a smallish living room with people sitting on every available surface... suddenly I heard slapping footsteps growing louder and louder as they reached the front door and Layne flew in, completely breaking down and crying so deeply that he looked truly frightened and lost. Very childlike. He looked up at everyone at once, and I had this sudden urge to run over and grab him and give him a big hug and tell him everything was going to be okay... I didn't get up in front of the room and offer that and I still regret it. No one else did, either. I don't know why.

- DANNY GOLDBERG (Gold Mountain Entertainment founder/president; Nirvana/ Hole manager; Atlantic Records president; Warner Bros. Records chairman/CEO; Rosemary Carroll's husband) The first meeting I had with Nirvana, Krist did most of the talking. Kurt didn't do much talking, and Dave Grohl did no talking. I asked at one point if they wanted to stay on Sub Pop. Kurt, who had been quiet up until then, just said, "No, definitely not!" He wanted to be big. They committed to us after the first meeting.

- BUZZ OSBORNE I was friends with Dave Grohl when he was in Scream. Dave has a really good sense of humor. Really severe black humor. Actually, he had some pretty great stories about Scream's black bass player. I think that those stories would have been good regardless of what color he was. Dave called me when I lived in San Francisco. The Nirvana guys were in town, so we went and saw Scream play. It's been written that I took them there to see Dave Grohl play, but that's not true. I was going to go anyway.

- BUZZ OSBORNE A couple of weeks later, I got a call from Dave, and he was in L.A., stranded. The bassist of Scream had sold all their gear. And I said, "Well, you know, Nirvana's looking for a drummer." And I didn't know at that time that they'd already hired Danny Peters. And Dave said, "Really?," because he was looking for anything he could do. And so I called the Nirvana guys and said, "Remember that drummer that you saw play for Scream? Well, he's looking for something to do. Call him up."

- DAVE GROHL This girl sits down and she plays the most saddest, depressing fuckin' [song]. And there's all these people who look like they're fuckin' Scooby Doo, with the glasses, and they're just sad, and hot. chocolate party shit and all of that crap. And we're there with our beers like, "What the fuck is going on? This place is screwed, man. This is horrible." So the first phone call I had with Kurt... I'm like, "Man, afterwards we fuckin' went to this party at someone's apartment, and it was kinda fucked, man, 'cause we showed up and we had all our beer and shit. And then this fuckin' girl starts playing this shitty fuckin' depressing fuckin' bullshit." He's like, "Yeah, that's my girlfriend." (Laughs.) I'm like, "Ohhh... Whoops. Whoopsie daisy."

- RICH JENSEN (Sub Pop Records general manager; musician) The first job I had at Sub Pop, in '91, was to go into the previous bookkeeper's office, which was completely strewn with paper, and determine what was a bill. And I put them in a big stack, organized them, and then typed everything into a spreadsheet, which those guys had apparently never heard of. That was my great talent: I knew what a spreadsheet was. I printed it out on an old-fashioned, dot-matrix printer, and it was a six-foot-long list that I hung up on the window in Bruce's office. At the bottom it said we owed $250,000. We had $5,000 in the bank. That was probably May. Megan was let go that summer. Most of the staff was. We were reduced to a core group of like five people.

- MARCO COLLINS (KNDD DJ) My first major radio job was at a station called 91X in San Diego. I was doing a local music show, and I was relegated to Sunday nights after 10. Eddie Vedder was in a band called Bad Radio that I used to play. We never met in San Diego, we just knew each other on the phone, because he would call my show all the time and request that I play his band. He was the guy doing all the work in the band, in terms of promoting it. He wrote that song "Better Man" in '88. It took a different shape when Pearl Jam recorded it. Bad Radio were a little bit more funky; they had that Chili Peppers thing going on a little.

- EDDIE VEDDER 1 never knew my real dad. I had another father that I didn't get along with, a guy I thought was my father. There were fights and bad, bad scenes. I was kind of on my own at a pretty young age. I never finished high school. [My mother] came out [to San Diego] with the specific purpose to tell me that this guy wasn't my father.... At first I was pretty happy about it, then she told me who my real dad was. I had met the guy three or four times, he was a friend of the family, kind of a distant friend. He died of multiple sclerosis. So when I met him, he was in the hospital.... I had to deal with the fact that he was dead. My real father was not on this earth. I had to deal with the anger of not being told sooner, not being told while he was alive.

- CHRIS CORNELL I had written "Say Hello to Heaven" and "Reach Down," and I had recorded them by myself at home. My initial thought was I could record them with the ex-members of Mother Love Bone as a tribute single to Andy. And I got a phone call from Jeff, saying he just thought the songs were amazing and let's make a whole record. When we started rehearsing the songs, I had pulled out "Hunger Strike" and I had this feeling it was just kind of gonna be filler, it didn't feel like a real song. Eddie was sitting there kind of waiting for a [Mookie Blaylock] rehearsal and I was singing parts, and he kind of humbly—but with some balls— walked up to the mic and started singing the low parts for me because he saw it was kind of hard. We got through a couple choruses of him doing that and suddenly the lightbulb came on in my head, this guy's voice is amazing for these low parts. History wrote itself after that, that became the single. ...

- SCOTT VANDERPOOL (KXRX/KCMU DJ; Room Nine drummer) I did an on-air interview with Eddie Vedder at KXRX when he was pretty new to the area. The one thing that I remember about it was that when we were listening to songs and talking in between, he said he didn't want me mentioning on the air that he'd been hanging out with Chris Cornell. He didn't want to be seen as some kind of rock star.

- ROBERT ROTH I was at the OK Hotel the night that Nirvana debuted "Smells Like Teen Spirit," and across the street there was a private thing where they were filming Alice in Chains for Singles. At the time, there was the punk-rock side of the street, which I was on—1 was more of a Mudhoney, Sonic Youth, Nirvana kind of grunge fan. Then there was another side, which was more connected to that late-'80s metal scene.

- NICK TERZO Alice in Chains were the first band to have radio success in that movement, and that's a fact. It's been revised since, but the fact of the matter is, "Man in the Box" broke down tons of doors. The albur came out in August 1990, but radio started playing "Man in the Bal in early 1991. And after that, their song "Would?" broke down doors on alternative radio- and then Nirvana went right through. The video for "Man in the Box" was pretty dark. Sort of the antithesis of a lot of stuff on the channel. Alice in Chains felt like it was something new, and Thunder felt like it was something old. That was the first sign: When MTV opts for this Alice in Chains band over a hair band, that was starting the tides turning.

- JEFF AMENT The first time I mentioned Pearl Jam [as a band name] was when Ed, Stone, and I were watching Sonic Youth play with Crazy Horse. In the middle of Crazy Horse, I turned to Stone and said, "What about 'Pearl Jam'?" A couple of years later, the first time that we played [Neil Young's] Bridge School [benefit], I saw Neil's big black, must have been a '55 Chevy, and the license plate says PEARL 10. I think I'm in a dream. I asked Neil how long he'd had those plates, and he said 15 years.

- KATHLEEN HANNA Bikini Kill singer) In August of 1990, I found myself laying on my stomach, in the woods, with a pair of binoculars, a bottle of Canadian Club, and my friend Kurt Cobain. The reason why I had the binoculars was because I was the lookout while he ran across the street to a teen pregnancy center that had just opened in our town. And it really wasn't a teen pregnancy center. It was a right-wing con where they got teenage girls to go in there and then told them they were gonna go to hell if they had abortions. Since Kurt and I were angry young feminists in the '90s, we decided that we were gonna do a little public service that night. We drank our Canadian Club, and he watched out while I went across the street and wrote FAKE ABORTION CLINIC, EVERYONE, 'cause I was kinda like the pragmatic one. And he was more creative, so he went over, and in six-foot-tall red letters he wrote GOD IS GAY. He was kinda cool like that.

- BUTCH VIG One night we went to see L7 play, and I didn't know this, but Kurt and Krist took mushrooms, and Krist was driving. He had also drank like half a bottle of whiskey by the time we got there. After the show, they disappeared The next morning I went in at noon, and at 1 or 2, no band. I kept calling, "Where's the band?" Finally, I got a call from Silva at 4 or 5, and he said, "Krist was driving the van on one of the canyon roads, drunk and tripping." And when he got pulled over, there was still like a quarter of a bottle of Jack Daniel's, and Krist was like, "I don't want him to fuckin' catch me with it," so he chugged the rest literally in the 30 seconds it takes the cop to walk up to the van. So he was completely out of his mind. Of course, they arrested him and took him to the slammer.

- BARRETT JONES (Nirvana drum tech; Laundry Room Studio owner/operator) When they were recording Nevermind in L.A., I flew out and stayed with them for a week. I remember they were trying to figure out that song "Stay Away." The original lyric was "pay to play," and they didn't like that. And I suggested "stay away." Not that they would remember that. After listening to playbacks of most of the stuff, I told Kurt, "Man, this is amazing. You're going to be on the cover of Rolling Stone within a year." Oh, I totally believed it, and I was totally right.

- BEN SHEPHERD First time I heard anything off of Nevermind, I thought, Wow, these guys are going for number one. We heard some songs that somebody snuck out of the studio down to our studio. Chris is in the other room mixing "Slaves & Bulldozers." Matt and Kim are in this room listening to Nevermind. I think it was the song "Come as You Are." And I stood in the hallway and I could hear my friends listening to my friends and watched my other friend work on a song that me and my friends had put together. So it was really intense. I stood there watching these two different worlds going on. Then I walked towards Chris, towards the music we were working on, instead of listening to someone else.

- BUZZ OSBORNE Nirvana management was never nice to us. Outright fucking asshole bastards. Right when Nevermind came out, we played a show with Nirvana in New York. Their manager, John Silva, said to me, "If you were a real band, on a real tour you'd understand that this is just fine." Meaning them fucking us over in one form or another: T-shirts, money, everything. That's the defining moment for me with Nirvana management. Somebody can only say that to me once, and then I hate their guts forever. Nirvana had surrounded themselves with regular rock-and-roll people by then. The same rock-and-roll road crew that now does Nine Inch Nails-type tours. I generally don't get along with those types of people, for good reason, mostly because they're a bunch of human turds. I've never met a group of people who hate music more than rock-and-roll professionals. After John Silva gave me that speech, I walked out into the lobby of the club, the Marquee, where there were huge, floor-to-ceiling Nirvana Nevermind posters up. Right under the baby on the Nirvana record cover, I wrote in huge letters THE MELVINS SAY NIRVANA suX for everybody to see when they came in. And Silva went out there and tore it all down. That was pretty funny.

- DANNY GOLDBERG I remember when Nirvana played a headlining show in L.A. right after Nevermind came out. Eddie Rosenblatt, the president of Geffen Records, was there with Axl Rose. Guns N' Roses was the biggest act on Geffen, and Nirvana were the second-biggest act. And he came up to me and said that Axl wanted to come by Nirvana's dressing room. I knew Eddie was on the spot—he had to look empowered to his star—but I had a pretty good idea of what Kurt was gonna think. I told Kurt about it, and he just made a face. Kurt just didn't like the idea of Axl. I said, "Look, man, why don't you and I just duck out of the dressing room? You won't have to talk to him because you won't be there." Kurt and I went and sat on the stairs, and I gave Eddie all the passes so at least he could walk Axl into the dressing room and maybe say hello to the other guys.

- BRYN BRIDENTHAL (Geffen Records publicity head) Axl wanted Nirvana to open for Guns because he, too, heard in the music something really, really special, and he wanted to do whatever he could to help, figuring they were this new young band and not realizing that they were at the front of a movement. He just didn't understand why they didn't want to, and Amy—his sister, who worked for him—called me one day and said, "Why won't they take our help?" I said, "Because you represent everything that they're against. You're a big, successful, corporate million-dollar rock band. That's the antithesis of Nirvana." But Axl didn't think of Guns in that way.

- JEFF GILBERT With Nirvana's success, all of the sudden, heavy-metal chicks who'd been dressing in spandex and fishnets and stilet hon now they started showing up to shows and they had washed all the Aqua Net out of their hair and they started to lol as taty as some af the guys. I thought, Oh no, the beginning of the end.

- BRET MICHAELS When I heard "Smells Like Teen Spirit," I'm goin' "Well, goddamn, what a great song," Someone forgot to send me the memo that I'm supposed to be hating this or threatened by it. My career: didn't end with grunge. My career with the media ended with grunge Most bands get a couple-year window to slowly die down. The media didn't kinda shut us off. They completely shut us off. But there were three bands in our genre that stayed in the arena: Def Leppard, Bor Jovi, Poison.

- SLASH (guitarist for Los Angeles's Guns N° Roses) February 1, 1992, was our last show with Soundgarden, at Compton Terrace, Arizona, and we decided to commemorate it with a little prank. We got ourselves a few inflatable sex dolls, and Matt and Duff and I took our clothes off and went onstage with them. Come to think of it, I was the only one of us completely naked. In any case, Soundgarden was touring the Badmotonfinger album, and they came from a place where there was no fun to be had while rocking, so they were mortified. They looked around and there we were screwing blow-up dolls all around them; I was drunk and I fell. I got separated from my doll, and at that point I was totally naked—it was a scene.

- SUSAN SILVER It was Soundgarden's nature to never be enthusiastic about anything, to the point where the Guns N' Roses crew referred to them as Frowngarden.

- BEN SHEPHERD Why'd we get called Frowngarden? Because we weren't party monsters. We weren't motherfucking rock stars. We were not like that. We were there to play music. We weren't there for the models and the cocaine. We were there to blow your doors off.

- JANET BILLIG Right when it started coming out that Kurt was doing drugs, I remember Steven Tyler called and wanted to help. I told Kurt, "Holy shit, Steven Tyler called my office and he wants to help you. Can I give him your number?" And he was like, "Steven Tyler got to be a junkie for 18 fuckin' years. I've only been doing drugs for an hour." Lots of stars called. Kirstie Alley called a lot for Courtney to try and make her become a Scientologist.

- MARK KATES At least among those of us who were professionaly in-volved, it was pretty safe to say there was a rivalry between Nirvana and Pearl Jam. And from our standpoint, it was based on a record that we didn't really believe was musically related, even though they were from the same city and the same scene. To be fair, those guys in Pearl Jam were at it before the guys in Nirvana were on a significant level, because they were in Green River and Mother Love Bone. But we were frustrated that this other career was launched off the back of our band. Alternative rock had a lot of rules. The biggest accomplishment of this era, and Pearl Jam deserves as much credit as Nirvana does, was breaking the rules those of us who were alt-rock lifers had, Pearl Jam broke them musically, and Jeff Ament's haircut kind of broke the nles too. All that band did was prove how stupid all those rules were. You can sing any way you want to. You want strings in your record, go ahead.

- STONE GOSSARD It was painful at times. All those words that were used to describe Pearl Jam—as posers, as somebody who's getting a hand up from the label, as someone who is more manipulative than talented, not the real thing compared to Nirvana— all it did was raise the bar for Pearl Jam. I think we took them as challenges, and we had to discover whether we were being real to the situation, or am I a jerk? I went to Mark Lanegan's apartment, and we talked for about three hours and by the end of it he asked me to be their manager, and I said yes. They had the reputation of being a little wild, but I had worked with some of the most difficult bands out there, including the Chili Peppers. This is the funny part: He said, "You have to say it out loud in order for it to be real. I want you to say, I am the new manager of the Screaming Trees." I said, "Okay. I am the new manager of the Screaming Trees." When I said those words out loud, I kind of felt like, My life is over.

- KIM THAVIL When Pearl Jam started going through the roof, the record company, in a very cynical move, decided to rerelease Temple of the Dog to capture and hang on to the success of Pearl Jam. They released "Hunger Strike," which featured Eddie's vocals prominently. Of course, as a record company guy, you should do that. Chris doing Temple of the Dog ultimately helped Soundgarden, in that it got him to exercise some of his creativity muscles and bring that back to Soundgarden. It was bad in that at some point, I think Temple of the Dog was outselling Badmotorfinger.

- TAD DOYLE People were wearing flannel here long before grunge came out. It's cold here. It's a cheap and effective clothing apparatus for living in the Northwest. I don't even associate it with a fashion statement or the lack thereof. I thought Eddie Vedder did more for flannel than anybody.

- COURTNEY LOVE Marc Jacobs sent me and Kurt his Perry Ellis grunge collection. Do you know what we did with it? We burned it. We were punkers—we didn't like that kind of thing.

- KEVIN MARTIN (Candlebox singer) The Seattle scene? We were the redheaded stepchild. We were in the right place at the right time. Fortunately, our music had its own voice. Unfortunately, everybody beLieved that we had moved there to steal the sound. Does talking about it stir up bad feelings? Not at all. It's easy to talk about. It was a scene that was fuckin' groundbreaking. In Seattle, it's rain, there's not a lot of punk rock, there's what I call dirgy rock-slow, down-tuned, heavy-which is. what everybody named grunge.

- KELLY GRAY Courtney Love kept saying Candlebox were from L.A. She didn't know where the fuck the band was from. People like her were saying that just because Nirvana was huge, Candlebox should've just never been a band. They should've just quit. It's fucking ridiculous.

- DANNY GOLDBERG 1 remember visiting Courtney in the hospital after Frances was born, and the article had just come out. She was sobbing. She said, "Things will never be the same, this is terrible. Don't give me your optimistic shit!" The social services got involved and there was a question of whether they were fit parents, and Courtney had to go to the welfare office a few times and show that she wasn't on drugs. Her sister had to be flown down to temporarily help look after the baby. It was three or four weeks of tremendous anxiety.

- DAN PETERS When your name is Mudhoney, you tend to get things like mud thrown at you when it's raining out. Onstage, Mark was pelted in the face with a big mud ball by somebody who he had taunted and teased: "You guys don't play baseball —you throw like a bunch of pus-sies." Got hit squarely in the face. Good times.

- JENNIFER FINCH People were throwing mud at us when we were play-ing. Donita was like, "Fuck this!" and went behind her amp and pulled out her tampon and threw it into the audience. It was hysterical. That's something we used to do, growing up: drive around and pull our tampons out and throw them at people that made comments. It's the ultimate kind of "fuck you." I always thought Donita was a bit of a reactionary, but thank God, she just expressed how angry and upset she was at that moment.

- EVERETT TRUE It was just around the time Frances Bean was born. Everybody's saying the kid's been born a freak, it was deformed. Also, there's all these rumors that Nirvana weren't gonna show and Kurt had OD'd. I was slumped against one of the walls of Nirvana's trailer with a bottle of vodka, and then, all of a sudden it must be getting close to the time, and somebody was yelling, "Where's the wheelchair?" Kurt came over to me, and he's like, "It's gonna be a burn on all those people who say I'm in the hospital and I've OD'd. I'm gonna wheel myself on in a wheelchair and pretend I've just come from the hospital, and we got this smock here." I'm like, 'That's a great idea! Why don't you get me to push you on the stage? That will be even funnier." I can remember pushing him on the stage, and it was around 9 o'clock at night. You can just hear this massive roar and feel all this steam and sweat coming from the front and the lights blinding you. I was trying to walk in a straight line, and so I start pushing Kurt towards the mic, and he reaches up and grabs me. I thought, Oh cool, he wants to have a mock fight onstage like we always used to have. So I start kind of punching him, and he's saying, "No, you asshole, you're pushing me to the wrong microphone." RICK KRIM "Jeremy" went on to become Video of the Year and blew the band up, and made them not want to make videos anymore. I have a Pearl Jam "Choices" poster in my office with a little girl, that was actually Kelly Curtis's daughter when she was two years old, kneeling with a gun and a bunch of crayons in front of her. Choices. The band signed the poster back then, and Eddie wrote right underneath the gun, "This is the gun we couldn't show in the video, but we ended up showing too much anyway." Meaning exposure-wise, I think.

- JANET BILLIG Axl Rose was with Stephanie Seymour. He turned to Kurt and said, "You tell your bitch to shut up! And Kurt looked at Courtney and said, completely deadpan, "Shut up, bitch." Hilarious. Then Stephanie said to Courtney, "Are you a model?" I think she was trying to be mean. Courtney was like, "Are you a brain surgeon?" We laughed and laughed and laughed for days.

- BRYN BRIDENTHAL Courtney and Axl spent so much time thinking about each other. Years later, when Axl was starting work on the album that would become Chinese Democracy, Jim Barber was A&Ring the project. And Axi at one point told me that Jim came to the studio and Axl felt Courtney Love energy coming off of him and made Jim leave. He couldn't work with that energy in the room. What I found out later, and Axl didn't know then, either, is that Barber had taken up with Courtney. They kept it a secret from me and the company. So for Axl to feel Courtney Love energy coming off Jim Barber's forehead, not knowing that they had a relationship, was sort of like, Whooooo! It was just amazing. Axl would do those kinds of things all the time. This is going to sound ridiculous, but it's true: He's a very spiritual person. Jim's work on the album ended shortly after the Courtney energy came off his fore-head, Because Axl thought that Courtney was evil and that her evilness would impact on his record.

- SUSAN SILVER Not that the others weren't heavily into drugs, too, but Layne was clearly so deep—it was so dangerous-that all of our lives centered around how to aid him. It was never about, "How are we going to prop him up to get him on a tour?" I had this conversation with Layne over and over and over after the success of Facelift: "Your health is the most important thing. You need to get well. Stop this. You have enough money, you can go buy a cottage on the beach and be there with Demri"—who was also very artistic—"and you can go and create whatever art you want."

- DAVE JERDEN Layne was worse off. He had a drug dealer that was hanging out with him the whole time while I was mixing the record. In fact, Layne came in to listen to it, and he brought his drug dealer with him. His drug dealer made some comment about the mix, what he wanted to have changed on the mix, and I blew up. I said, "Fuck you! Who are you?" And Layne told the guy to settle down and shut up. The drug dealer had some input on my mix.

- SCOTT MCCULLUM Oh, my God, Gruntruck and Alice in Chains were a perfect fit. We started off doing a "shitty cities" tour, basically all of these shitty little towns in the Northwest, in 1992. One time, we were up in Butte, Montana. Jerry's a big outdoorsman, so we went fishing together and caught a bunch of brown trout. We took'em back to the next show, probably at Missoula, and went to this frat-boy party afterward. Jerry and I walk in with this bag of fish, looking at all these frat boys and girls, and we're like, "Where's your kitchen?" We just went into the kitchen and started cooking up these fucking trout without even knowing whose house it was.

- KIM WHITE The Screaming Trees got offered the Alice in Chains tour, and I thought it was a terrible idea. Honestly, I thought, You're going to put an alcoholic on the road with a junkie, and when the tour is over you're going to have two junkies. I said that to the label and they were like, "Nonsense." Alice in Chains were huge, and they're like, "You're going to be playing huge arenas, you're going to sell a lot of records," and I was like, "Yeah, but at what expense?"

- GILLIAN G. GARR I didn't even realize that they had disavowed Nevermind until reading the book Come as You Are. It was mainly Kurt, and to some extent the others. He said he was embarrassed by Nevermind and that it wasn't the kind of record he would listen to. He said it sounded closer to a Mötley Crüe album.

- BUTCH VIG To me, that record doesn't sound slick at all. It sounds like a band playing their asses off in a room. To me what sounded slick were the metal records that were coming out, like Whitesnake. Nirvana was super-happy with Nevermind. Initially I may have been a little hurt by what Kurt said, but I knew that Kurt had to say that because, what can you say, "We sold 10 million records. I loved the way the record sounds"? That's not very punk.

- CHRIS CORNELL When all the bands in the Seattle music scene went on to major labels and bigger success, there was this kind of "Let's pretend that we don't wanna be doing this and someone's sort of forcing us to do it" attitude. I think everybody had it, including members of my own band. The only band I didn't see acting like that was Alice in Chains, because they didn't come from that indie-rock world. Everybody else sort of followed the punk-rock bible, and it wasn't part of punk rock to be on a major label, to make money, to make videos, to spend more than $2,000 on making a record, to be on a tour bus instead of driving a van. And yet, that's what everyone was doing.

- DANNY GOLDBERG Kurt was pretty drugged out. He was also upset that they didn't have songs. Kurt was tremendously committed to the punk culture, but he was a traditionalist when it came to songwriting. He listened to the Beatles a lot. He didn't only listen to Black Flag and the Dead Kennedys and the Melvins. He was very disappointed that, in his mind, they hadn't prepared for the record the way he prepared for his records. They didn't have mate-rial. They were, he felt, more like jamming. I suggested that he cowrite with them, but he wasn't that excited about doing that. Buzz asked him to also. Kurt was kind of possessive about his material. He didn't write for Courtney, either. He liked his good songs to be for him. Buzz said something about Courtney later on that got Courtney upset. I don't remember what it was. Courtney was all pissed and said, "I want Kurt to take his name off the album." I said, "Kurt, Id really rather you not take your name off the album." He said, Td never take my name off the album, don't worry about it."

- BUZZ OSBORNE Courtney actually went public saying that I tried to murder Kurt Cobain. That I actually took a syringe of heroin and tried to shoot him up and kill him. Somebody pointed out to me that it was online. That's an absolute fabrication from someone who is insane. It's complete and utter garbage. The people from Babes in Toyland are friends with her and they said that she would tell them these rambling stories about how I wanted rid of Kurt because I was jealous of his fame, and at that point I was like, "That makes no sense at all. This is the biggest PR guy we've ever had and you think I want to kill him? Why the fuck would I do that?" She first said these things publicly two or three years ago: "Oh, yeah, Buzz tried to OD my husband." So she waited until now to say this? I don't know about you, but if somebody was trying to kill my wife, I probably would have gone crazy over it. I wouldn't wait 15 years to mention it. It doesn't really do much for her case, does it? She's fabricated this bullshit story to drag me through the mud once again.

- BUZZ OSBORNE Remember this: How do you know when Courtney Love is lying? Her lips are moving.

- JEFF AMENT Recording Vs., there was a lot more pressure on Ed. The whole follow-up. I thought we were playing so well as a band that it would take care of itself. Toward the end it got fairly intense. He was having a hard time finishing up the songs; the pressure, and not being comfortable being in such a nice place. We tried to make it as uncomfortable for him as we could. He slept in the freaking sauna.

- ERIC JOHNSON I got to go bail Eddie out of jail at 5 in the morning. By the time I got there, he'd already made friends with everybody. He was laughing and talking to the other guys in the holding cell. I remember the smell of alcohol when I got there. It almost fuckin' burned my eyes. It was Eddie. He had been having a serious party.

- EDDIE VEDDER But I never threw a punch. Thank goodness. Because-who knows? —I could really have hurt him... So there's this guy, a talented and well-respected friend of mine who's lying on the ground unconscious because of this little dick who's saying to me, "You're not my Messiah, you're not my Messiah..." And I'm going, "That's what I was trying to tell you, man. That's what I was trying to tell you. I'm not your fuckin' Messiah."

- COURTNEY LOVE 1 put Pat Smear into Nirvana because Kurt needed someone to make him happy, and no one in that band did. We thought of putting Dylan [Carlson] in, but it was just like, "You'll be dead in a month," which Kurt heartily agreed with. I'm like, "I know someone. He's really fucking funny. Im not gonna say he's the greatest guitar player in the world, but my God, he will make you laugh."

- ALEX COLETTI Nirvana had agreed to do Unplugged, and the first meeting where I give the spiel about what I allow, what I don't allow, was after their show somewhere outside of Boston. When the show was over, we went back into the band room. I was sat next to Kurt. I said, "I just wanted to talk about the show real quick." I had just brought some set drawings and I showed it to him. He had asked for stargazer lilies. He said, "I want more, I want more." I said, "What's the vibe you're goin' for?" He said, "You know, like a funeral." But it wasn't like, bummm, heavy music plays and foreshadowing.

- AMY FINNERTY The day of the Unplugged show, they were all nervous. I went to Kurt's hotel before the show and he told me that he felt nervous and uncomfortable with the idea that people had to sit down the whole time and I said, "What would make you feel more comfortable?" He said, "Td really like to meet some of the kids first." So I bring him to the venue and he came into the studio where we were shooting and went around and he met the kids and hugged them before the performance, which was really sweet.

- AMY FINNERTY At the end of it [Unplugged], we went back to the hotel, and Kurt said to me, "I didn't do very good." I said, "What are you talking about? That was a historical moment, that was a really incredible performance. Why do you feel like you didn't do very good?" He said, "Because everybody was so quiet, nobody really clapped that loud and they just kind of sat there." I said something to the effect of, *People felt like they were seeing Jesus Christ for the first time. It was intense for people. They were trying to be respectful by being quiet and just letting you do your thing." And then he kind of got a little smirk on his face and said, "Thank you."

- COURTNEY LOVE Dylan and Lanegan were pretty much the only friends Kurt had. He really didn't have any friends. He liked the dealers, which was gross. He liked being isolated. I have this thing, me and my manager call it the Rocket. It's what happened to Kurt, it's what happened to me. It's what happened to Eminem. It's what happened to Britney Spears. Instead of just going up in steps—you're an apprentice with a mentor, you learn your craft, you go up to the next level and the next level-you disappear into the Rocket. You have to fight centrifugal force. Who's our friend? Who's not our friend? Who do we fire? What do we do? What's gross? What's not?

- COURTNEY LOVE It's only known to the inner circle that Kurt's first suicide attempt with a note was in December of'93. It was at home, around Christmas. I did all that shit you do, like CPR, like punching, poking, cold water. He wrote a big note, it was like a few diary pages, a list of reasons why he shouldn't be alive and blah blah blah and how he could never stop doing heroin. It's like, It's the fuckin' '90s. The '90s are going to be gone. Keith Richards does dope or did it for as long as ... Whatever, its your lifestyle. The inner circle? Janet knew about it, Rosemary knew about it, Danny knew about it, David Geffen knew about it.

- MARCO COLLINS In '98, I ended up going to rehab at Exodus, the same place in Los Angeles that Kurt went to. There was a little courtyard there where people go out to smoke, where he jumped over the wall to escape. It was a horrible situation, but it's somewhat humorous that Kurt jumped the fuckin' wall instead of just walking around to the exit. The counselors there laughed about it well after the fact. They were like, "All he had to do is walk around to the side door to leave. We're not jail." It was very punk rock of him to escape rehab.

- CHRIS CORNELL I think Pearl Jam was the band that set the perfect example. Their big video, "Jeremy," propelled them into becoming TV stars and one of the biggest rock bands on the planet, so they stopped making videos, which was proof positive that that wasn't where they wanted to be. And that made a lot of sense to me. Nirvana doing an Unplugged at the time that they did it and making a video for "Heart-Shaped Box," that didn't make a lot of sense to me, because it seemed clear to me that Kurt was pretty disillusioned by the situation that he was being put in. It felt like, If he's so unhappy, he shouldn't be doing this kind of stuff.

- BOB WHITTAKER 1 was in Seattle, and my friend David called me in the morning, saying, "Is it true?" I said, "What?" He goes, "They're saying on the radio that Kurt's dead." I said, "Oh, my God, I don't doubt it." I hung up the phone and the next call was from Nik Hartshorne, who was the King County coroner. Nik had been doing all the wrongful deaths in Seattle. We had a lot of mutual friends, and he used to go to shows all the time. We'd had drinks recently, and he asked, "How's Kurt doing;" I said, "Not very good. I wouldn't be surprised if he paid you a visit soon." This was three days before they found him. When I talked with Nik on the phone I said, "Jesus, I just heard. Are you getting stuck with the autopsy?" And he said, "I just got done." And then he said, "I wish we wouldn't have had that conversation the other day."

- BEN SHEPHERD The thing for Soundgarden was every time there was some personal gain, it was always balanced out by something really dark. We were in Europe when we found out that Superunknown was number one in America. Then Kurt dies.

- GRANT ALDEN My girlfriend at the time and I had a vacation planned on the Olympic Peninsula the next day. When we drove through Aberdeen, there was no sign that Kurt Cobain had lived or died. I still think that those church billboards should have said something. There should have been a kind word for that family, and there was nothing. Why not? Well, what they say out here is, "He got above his raising." He was white trash, he got to be a star; he moved away and then he did drugs and he died. They didn't approve of him alive, they didn't approve of him dead.

- KURT COBAIN (from his suicide note) Thank you all from the pit of my burning, nauseous stomach for your letters and concern during the past years. I'm too much of an erratic, moody baby! I don't have the passion anymore, and so remember, it's better to burn out than to fade away.

- MATT LUKIN I had another joint that I was going to smoke on the way, but all of the sudden, I realize, We're on our way straight to the fuckin' White House. I got no time to light this thing up. So I ate it. I'm chewing on this fucking joint, and it's all dry. After I'm already really stoned anyway.

- MATT LUKIN We got a behind-the-velvet-rope tour. Then some kid recognized us as Mudhoney and asked us for an autograph. So, sure, we gave him an autograph, and as soon as that went down, people just started pouring in, thinking we were Pearl Jam. We're like, "No, no, no, you don't know who we are. You don't want our autograph." And they're like, "No, no, you're Pearl Jam."

- ERIC ERLANDSON In our Western society, Courtney's known and she's an archetype—it's like she's this destroyer woman, kind of like a Medusa type. People tend to not like that type of woman, not realizing that we all have that inside us, and the more you hate it on the outside, the more you activate it inside. Deep down inside, she's just a person with a soul, with her own karma, with her own life and her own experiences, and we don't understand what that is and where she came from. You watch Behind the Music and think, Oh, now I know her. But you don't know shit.

- WAYNE COYNE (singer for Oklahoma City's the Flaming Lips) Candlebox wasn't just the nail in the coffin of grunge. To me, they arrived as the coffin of grunge music. We ended up going to this parking lot, hiding, and there's probably 30 cars there, all blaring music. People smoking weed and drinking beer. All teenagers. We had the windows down, we were just parked, smoking cigarettes. Some kids recognized Layne, and they were like, "Dude, ther's Layne Staley!" And the other guys were like, "No, it's not. He wouldn't be in Lake Chelan." And they all came up to the car, probably 15 kids, and they're like, "If you're Layne Staley, prove it." And Layne was just looking straight ahead. Sunglasses on, 2 o'clock in the morning, wouldn't even acknowledge them. Finally, one of the guys pulls up in a truck, cranks "No Excuses," and he goes, "If you're Layne Staley, sing along!" And Layne started singing. Sang the verse, sang the chorus. Nailed it, exactly like it sounded on the record. All the kids were like, "Holy shit, it's fuckin' him!" He sang that, just to be, Get the fuck out of my face! Kind of proved who he was, and then he's like, "Get out of here!" And then we drove off.

- JOHN HOYT What happened with Ticketmaster was that all those extra add-on fees were exorbitant. Pearl Jam has never been concerned just about making money, so they took on the cause. With all the extra charges, it meant that if they wanted to have a $20 ticket, it would cost $26. We were trying to cut deals with Ticketmaster to decrease those charges, but never were able to do it, and finally just said, "Screw it."

- MIKE MCCREADY A lot of hallucinogenic mushrooms grow in the area around Surrey, England, where we mixed the first Pearl Jam album, and the people there call the time when they come up the "Mad Season" because people are wandering around mad, picking mushrooms, half out of their minds. That term has always stuck in my mind, and I relate that to my past years, the seasons of drinking and drug abuse.

- BARRETT MARTIN Mike McCready, who I'd known off and on and had jammed with at house parties, said he wanted to form a band with this bass player, John Baker Saunders, who he'd met at the Hazelden rehab clinic. Mike asked me to come jam with him and Baker, and I said sure, since the Trees weren't doing anything. I immediately liked Baker because he had this blues background —he was from Chicago—and the three of us had this good chemistry. It was just real blues-based rock, it didn't sound grunge and it didn't sound like any of our bands. Mike said that he wanted to find a singer, and he mentioned Layne.

- BARRETT MARTIN Even though Id lost respect for Alice in Chains on tour because of the resonant attitude of "We're the big rock stars," I wasn't opposed to Layne being in the band, because he had an incredible voice and he was always cool. We did a couple of rehearsals with Layne and he was actually clean at that time; he had stopped using heroin. The beauty of that Mad Season record is that we were all sober. We wrote the songs in a couple weeks, played a couple unannounced shows, and recorded the album in about two weeks. It was fast.

- TOBY WRIGHT (producer/engineer) I had engineered Alice in Chains Jar of Flies acoustic EP—the first EP ever to debut at number one-which they recorded after they finished that Lollapalooza tour. The third Alice in Chains album, the one with the three-legged dog on the cover, started with me coming up to Seattle and working with Jerry at his house. The strategy between Susan, Jerry, and myself was to get me up there, and as soon as the other members heard I was in town, hopefully their ears would perk up and they'd go, "What's goin' on? What are we doin"? And that's exactly what happened. It got Sean interested, brought Mike in. All of a sudden, boom, we were jamming, and I'd go over to Layne's place and get him.

- TOBY WRIGHT One of the things that happened when we were recording was the Mad Season record went gold. So at 6 in the morning we were still in the studio with Layne, and the heads of Sony, Donnie Jenner and Michele Anthony, called and were congratulating him. And at the end of the conversation, they said, "Oh, yeah, by the way, you have nine days to get your record done." So they call him up to congratulate him and then threaten him. (Laughs.) So he wrote that into the lyrics. It's the second verse: "Call me up congratulations ain't the real why/There's no pressure besides brilliance let's say by day nine/Endless corporate ignorance lets me control time/By the way, by the way..." I think the recording process went another month or two after that. The band didn't do very much touring on the dog record, but they got ofered to do this Unplugged show by MTV, in 1996.

- MIKE INEZ Scotty Olson, who played with Heart, was playing with us that night [Unplugged]; it was really special to have another energy up onstage with us. We discovered at that show that songs like "Sludge Factory" were even heavier acoustic. Layne that night was so haunting. His voice, especially his performance on "Down in a Hole," it still brings a tear to my eye. There was a couple times I had to pull my eyes off of Layne and remind myself, Hey, I'm at work. Instead of being a fan here, I better concentrate on my bass chords. He was just so mesmerizing.

- TOBY WRIGHT 1 recorded it and mixed the show. It was an amazing performance to watch. With Unplugged, you can do a song as many times as you wanna until you capture the performance that you wanna release, but you can't do any overdubs. And Layne kept forgetting the words to "Sludge Factory" It got pretty funny. I think he was nervous because Donnie and Michele happened to be sitting right in front of him.

- MARK ARM The song has three little stories, and one is about Layne. I think Emily witnessed this—supposedly Layne was at the Mecca Café and his hands were all bandaged. He'd just come out of the hospital because he punched through a window or something. If you listen to the second Alice in Chains record, it's all songs about being a junkie. He went from dabbling with this thing to having it become a major part of his persona. That's the one who "Made his myth/Now he's trapped."

- JEFF SMITH I remember Mark saying he figured they hadn't really made it because there was no fake Mudhoney song on the first Stone Temple Pilots album. Beavis and Butt-Head were like, "Hey, Eddie Vedder got a new haircut!" "What, this isn't Pearl Jam?" It had a fake Alice in Chains song, a fake Nirvana song. That record is almost like a best-of-Seattle.

- DAVID KATZNELSON My Brother the Cow [1995]sold crappily. There was a backlash against grunge. The backlash didn't touch Soundgarden, it didn't touch Pearl Jam, because they were no longer grunge bands, they were pop bands. They had been accepted by a whole other audience.

- MIKE MONGRAIN (TAD drummer) My first show with TAD was August of '96. At that point, it was a band in decline. I liken it to stepping on the Titanic about five minutes post-iceberg. And I rode that bitch to the bottom, yeah. And there were so many crappy bands getting on the grunge bandwagon that were kind of a joke. I always had a serious distaste for bands like Stone Temple Pilots and Bush. They were capturing the essence of what was going on, at least the sound, but they were missing some-thing. Something that was tongue-in-cheek and humorous and ironic, like TAD or Mudhoney. I never caught a shred of humor in anything the Stone Temple Pilots or Bush were doing. They were being serious rockers, copping a sound and missing the irony.

- MIKE MONGRAIN I wanted to try to nudge us in a direction that was post-grunge. TAD had already been going in a more melodic direction, but it just didn't have the cohesion yet. I thought, Let's continue in that direction, with some more refinement. I remember when we were on tour in the Netherlands in '97, we walked past a department store and there was a display in the window. It had a whole bunch of flannel shirts hangin' in the window with a humongous sign that said 70 PERCENT OFF. I was like, "Guys! Look at that. Let that burn into your brain. That's the reality." But I guess a lightbulb shines brightest right before it burns out. I think "Laughing with Lucifer" [The Melvins] is truly the epitaph on the tombstone of grunge. Major labels brought it to the planet, exploited it, and then killed it when it was used up, like any self-respecting corporation would do.

- RODERICK ROMERO I was Krist Novoselic's best friend for five years, after Kurt's death. Krist really tried to help Layne, 'cause obviously he'd already lost Kurt, so it was like ... Krist is one of the most caring and kind and sincere people on the planet. He would show up at Layne's apartment, and bring food to him. Layne wouldn't let anybody in; he had surveillance cameras. Krist would come back and say, "I dropped more food off for him. Fuck." I'd say, "Well, anytime you want me to go with you ..." He said, "It's just kind of freaky. You don't want to." He really cared. It was like, maybe he could help save somebody.

- JEFF GILBERT Layne sequestered himself and did nothing but play video games and do drugs. I bumped into him probably about six months before he died, in the U District. He looked like an 80-year-old version of himself. He looked very jaundiced. He wore a leather jacket down to his fingertips to cover up all the needle marks. He had a knit hat on, pulled down, and his eyes were so sunken in, just dark. Smelled pretty ripe. I gave him a hug, and we talked for a while. I said, "Damn, man, you need to get out in the sun." That was my attempt at humor. But I felt this horrendous amount of sadness for him. He was a dead man walkin'.

- MIKE STARR He died the day after my birthday. And I was with him all that day, on my birthday, trying to keep him alive. I even asked him if I could call 911, and he said if I did he would never talk to me again. And of course, I didn't know he was gonna die, or I would've called 911 anyways. I wish I wouldn't have been high on benzodiazepine.... [Layne] just said, "I'm sick"... He was agitated because I was too high. He used to get mad at me when I took 'em. He'd be like, "You're an idiot on these pills." And then I got mad at him, and I said, "Fine, I'll just leave." And his last words to me were, "Not like this, don't leave like this." I just left him sitting there. His last words were, "Not like this." I can't believe that. I'm so ashamed of that.

- CHARLIE RYAN We were thrilled for everybody's success. My father called me one day and hes reading a review of Nirvana in the paper, and he's like, "You know these guys, right? I'm like, "Yeah, you know, we were playing the same places." "I don't understand this. How come all these guys are making all this money and you're not gettin' nothin' out of it?" I said, "Well, you know, Dad, we have our artistic integrity." He slammed the phone down. He hung up on me. He always busted my balls about the money: "So, you know these Soundgarden guys, and you know the Pearl Jams?" "Yeah, Dad." "And these guys all make millions of bucks?" "Yes, Dad." "But let me guess, you got your artistic integrity?" "That's right, Dad." When I was playing with Cat Butt, we were on some Sub Pop record, so we got these crummy little checks sent to us for years. One year, I framed this and gave it to my dad for Christmas. The letter says, "™m pleased to enclose mechanical royalties for blah blah blah." And look at how much the check was for: one dollar and 48 cents. My dad actually hung it up behind his couch. He thought it was hysterical.
