### Highlights

- Some things have to be done. It's better to do them, than to live in the fear of them.

- If a man seeks to change the world, he should first understand it.

- Knowledge is often the antidote to fear.

- Well. What can we do, except try to do better?

- The more you learn, the more you realize how little you know. Still, the struggle itself is worthwhile. Knowledge is the root of power, after all.
